<h3><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a></h3>

<p class="subtitle">TWO HAPHAZARDS</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span> began, I suppose, on a certain September afternoon,
when Roland Whately travelled back to
school by the three-thirty train from Waterloo.
There were two afternoon trains to Fernhurst: one left
London at three-thirty and arrived at a quarter to six;
the other left at four-eighteen, stopped at every station
between Basingstoke and Salisbury, waited twenty-five
minutes at Templecombe for a connection, and finally
reached Fernhurst at eight-twenty-three. It is needless
to state that by far the greater part of the school
travelled down by the four-eighteen&mdash;who for the sake
of a fast train and a comfortable journey would
surrender forty-eight minutes of his holidays?&mdash;and
usually, of course, Roland accompanied the many.</p>

<p>This term, however, the advantages of the fast train
were considerable. He was particularly anxious to
have the corner bed in his dormitory. There was a
bracket above it where he could place a candle, by
the light of which he would be able to learn his rep.
after "lights out." If he were not there first someone
else would be sure to collar it. And then there was the
new study at the end of the passage; he wanted to get
fresh curtains and probably a gas mantle: when once
the school was back it was impossible, for at least a
week, to persuade Charlie, the school custos, to attend
to an odd job like that. And so he travelled back by a
train that contained, of the three hundred boys who
were on the Fernhurst roll, only a dozen fags and three
timid Sixth-Formers who had distrusted the animal
spirits of certain powerful and irreverent Fifth-Formers.
On the first day, as on the last, privilege counts for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
little, and it is unpleasant to pass four hours under the
seat of a dusty railway carriage.</p>

<p>It was the first time that Roland had been able to
spend the first evening of a term in complete leisure.
He walked quietly up to the house, went down to the
matron's room and consulted the study and dormitory
lists. He found that he was on the Sixth-Form table, had
been given the study for which he had applied, and was
in the right dormitory. He bagged the bed he wanted,
and took his health certificate round to the Chief's
study.</p>

<p>"Ah, Whately, this is very early. Had a good
holiday?"</p>

<p>"Yes, thank you, sir."</p>

<p>"Feeling ready for football? They tell me you've an
excellent chance of getting into the XV.?"</p>

<p>"I hope so, sir."</p>

<p>He went over to the studies and inspected the gas
fittings. Yes, he would certainly need a new mantle,
and he must try to see if Charlie couldn't fit him up
with a new curtain. After a brief deliberation Charles
decided that he could; a half-crown changed hands,
and as Roland strolled back from the lodge the Abbey
clock struck half-past six. Over two hours to prayers.
He had done all his jobs, and there didn't seem to be a
soul in the place. He began to wonder whether, after
all, it had been worth his while to catch that early train:
it had been a dull journey, two hours in the company of
three frightened fags, outhouse fellows whom he didn't
know, and who had huddled away in a corner of the
carriage and talked in whispers. If, on the other hand,
he had waited for the four-eighteen he would at that
moment be sitting with five or six first-class fellows,
talking of last year's rags, of the new prefects, and the
probable composition of the XV. He would be much
happier there. And as for the dormitory and study,
well, he'd have probably been able to manage if he had
hurried from the station. He had done so a good many
times before. Altogether he had made a bit of an ass
of himself. An impetuous fool, that was what he was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>And for want of anything better to do, he mouched
down to Ruffer's, the unofficial tuck-shop. There was
no one he knew in the front of the shop, so he walked
into the inside room and found, sitting in a far corner,
eating an ice, Howard, one of the senior men in
Morgan's.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" he said. "So you've been ass enough to
come down by the early train as well?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I was coming up from Cornwall, and it's the
only way I could make the trains fit in. A bad
business. There's nothing to do but eat: come and
join me in an ice."</p>

<p>Howard was only a very casual acquaintance; he
was no use at games; he had never been in the same
form as Roland, and fellows in the School house usually
kept pretty much to themselves. They had only met
in groups outside the chapel, or at roll-call, or before a
lecture. It was probably the first time they had ever
been alone together.</p>

<p>"Right you are!" said Roland. "Mr Ruffer, bring
me a large strawberry ice and a cup of coffee."</p>

<p>But the ice did not last long, and they were soon
strolling up the High Street, with time heavy on their
hands. Conversation flagged; they had very little in
common.</p>

<p>"I know," said Howard. "Let's go down to the
castle grounds; they'll probably have a band, and we
can watch the dancing."</p>

<p>Half-way between the station and the school, opposite
the Eversham Hotel, where parents stopped for
"commem" and confirmation, was a public garden
with a band-stand and well-kept lawns, and here on
warm summer evenings dances would promote and encourage
the rustic courtships of the youthful townsfolk.
During the term these grounds were strictly out of
bounds to the school; but on the first night rules did
not exist, and besides, no one was likely to recognise
them in the bowler hats and coloured ties that would
have to be put away that night in favour of black
poplin and broad white straw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a warm night, and they leaned against the
railing watching the girls in their light print dresses
waltz in the clumsy arms of their selected.</p>

<p>"Looks awfully jolly," said Howard. "They don't
have a bad time, those fellows. There are one or two
rippingly pretty girls."</p>

<p>"And look at the fellows they're dancing with. I
can't think how they can stand it. Now look there, at
that couple by the stand. She's a really pretty girl,
while her man is pimply, with a scraggy moustache and
sweating forehead, and yet look how she's leaning over
his shoulder; think of her being kissed by that."</p>

<p>"I suppose there's something about him."</p>

<p>"I suppose so."</p>

<p>There was a pause: Roland wished that difference of
training and position did not hold them from the revel.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" said Roland, "it would be awful fun to
join them."</p>

<p>"Well, I dare you to."</p>

<p>"Dare say you do. I'm not having any. I don't run
risks in a place where I'm known."</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Roland did not run risks anywhere,
but he wanted Howard to think him something
of a Don Juan. One is always ashamed of innocence,
and Howard was one of those fellows who naturally
bring out the worst side of their companions. His
boisterous, assertive confidence was practically a
challenge, and Roland did not enjoy the rôle of listener
and disciple, especially as Howard was, by the school
standards, socially his inferior.</p>

<p>At that moment two girls strolled past, turned, and
giggled over their shoulders.</p>

<p>"Do you see that?" said Roland.</p>

<p>"What about it?"</p>

<p>"Well, I mean...."</p>

<p>The girls were coming back, and suddenly, to Roland's
surprise, embarrassment and annoyance, Howard walked
forward and raised his hat.</p>

<p>"Lonely?" he said.</p>

<p>"Same as you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>"Like a walk, then?"</p>

<p>"All right, if your friend's not too shy."</p>

<p>And before Roland could make any protest he was
walking, tongue-tied and helpless, on the arm of a full-blown
shop-girl.</p>

<p>"Well, you're a cheerful sort of chap, aren't you?"
she said at last.</p>

<p>"Sorry, but you see I wasn't expecting you!"</p>

<p>"Oh, she didn't turn up, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"I didn't mean that."</p>

<p>"Oh, get along, I know you; you're all the same.
Why, I was talking to a boy last week...."</p>

<p>To save her the indignity of a confession, Roland
suggested that they should dance.</p>

<p>"All right, only don't hold me too tight&mdash;sister's
looking."</p>

<p>There was no need to talk while they were dancing,
and he was glad to be able to collect his thoughts. It
was an awkward business. She wasn't on the whole
a bad-looking girl; she was certainly too plump, but
she had a nice smile and pretty hair; and he felt no
end of a dog. But it was impossible to become romantic,
for she giggled every time he tried to hold her a
little closer, and once when his cheek brushed accidentally
against hers she gave him a great push, and shouted,
"Now then, naughty!" to the intense amusement of
another couple. Still, he enjoyed dancing with her.
It would be something to tell the fellows afterwards.
They would be sitting in the big study. Gradually the
talk would drift round to girls. He would sit in silence
while the others would relate invented escapades, prefaced
by, "My brother told me," or, "I saw in a French
novel." He would wait for the lull, then himself would
let fall&mdash;oh! so gently&mdash;into the conversation, "a girl
that I danced with in the castle grounds...."</p>

<p>The final crash of the band recalled him to the requirements
of the moment, and the need for conversation.
They sat on a seat and discussed the weather,
the suitability of grass as a dancing floor, the superiority
of a band over a piano. He introduced subject after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
subject, bringing them up one after another, like the
successive waves of infantry in an attack. It was
not a success. The first bars of a waltz were a great
relief.</p>

<p>He jumped up and offered her his arm.</p>

<p>"From the school, aren't you?" she said.</p>

<p>"How did you guess?" he asked. She answered
him with a giggle.</p>

<p>It was a blow, admittedly a blow. He had not
imagined himself a shining success, but he had not
thought that he was giving himself away quite as badly
as that. They got on a great deal better though after
it. They knew where they were, and he found her a
very jolly girl, a simple creature, whose one idea was to
be admired and to enjoy herself, an ambition not so
very different from Roland's. It was her sense of
humour that beat him: she giggled most of the time;
why he could not understand. It was annoying, because
everyone stared at them, and Roland hated to be conspicuous.
He was prepared to enjoy the illusion but
not the reality in public. He was not therefore very
sorry when the Abbey clock warned him that in a few
minutes the four-eighteen would have arrived and that
the best place for him was the School house dining-room.</p>

<p>On the way back he met Howard.</p>

<p>"I say, you rather let me in for it, you know," he
said.</p>

<p>"Oh, rot, my dear chap; but even if I did, I'll bet
you enjoyed yourself all right."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I did. But that makes no difference.
After all, you didn't know I was going to. I'd never
seen the girl before."</p>

<p>"But one never has on these occasions, has one?
One's got to trust to luck: you know that as well as
I do."</p>

<p>"Of course, of course, but still...."</p>

<p>They argued it out till they reached the cloisters
leading to the School house studies, exchanged there
a cheery good-night and went their way. Five minutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
later the four-eighteen was in; the study passages were
filled with shouts; Roland was running up and down
stairs, greeting his old friends. The incident was
closed, and in the normal course of things it would
never have been reopened.</p>

<p>That it was reopened was due entirely, if indirectly,
to Roland's laziness on a wet Sunday afternoon, half
way through October. It was a really wet afternoon,
the sort of afternoon when there is nothing to be done
but to pack one's study full of really good chaps and
get up a decent fug. Any small boy can be persuaded,
with the aid of a shilling, to brew some tea, and there
are few things better than to sit in the window-seat and
watch the gravel courts turn to an enormous lake.
Roland was peculiarly aware of the charm of an afternoon
so spent as he walked across to his study after
lunch, disquieted by the knowledge that his football
boots wanted restudding and that the night before he
had vowed solemnly that he would take them down to
the professional before tea. It would be fatal to leave
them any longer, and he knew it. The ground on
Saturday had been too wet for football, and the whole
house had gone for a run, during which Roland had worn
down one of his studs on the hard roads, and driven a
nail that uncomfortable hundredth of an inch through
the sole of his boot. If he wore those boots again before
they had been mended that hundredth of an inch
would become a tenth of an inch, and make no small
part of a crater in his foot. It was obviously up to him
to put on a mackintosh and go down to the field at once.
There was no room for argument, and Roland knew it,
but....</p>

<p>It was very pleasant and warm inside the study and
damnably unpleasant anywhere else. If only he were
a prefect, and had a fag, how simple his life would
become. His shoes would be cleaned for him, his
shaving water would be boiled in the morning, his books
would be carried down to his classroom, and on this
rain-drenched afternoon he would only have to put his
head outside the study door and yell "Fag!" and it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
be settled. But he was not a prefect, and he had no fag.
It was no use growling about it. He would have to go,
of course he would have to go, then added as a corollary&mdash;yes,
certainly, at three o'clock. By that time the
weather might have cleared up.</p>

<p>But it had not cleared up by three o'clock, and
Roland had become hopelessly intrigued by a novel by
Wilkie Collins, called <cite>The Moonstone</cite>. He had just
reached the place where Sergeant Cuff looks up at
Rachel's window and whistles <cite>The Last Rose of Summer</cite>.
He could not desert Sergeant Cuff at such a point for a
pair of football boots, and at three o'clock, with the
whole afternoon before him. At half-past there would
be tons of time. But by half-past three it was raining
in the true Fernhurst manner, fierce, driving rain that
whipped across the courts, heavy gusts of wind that
shrieked down the cloisters. Impossible weather,
absolutely impossible weather. No one but a fool
would go out in it. He would wait till four, it was
certain to have stopped a bit by then.</p>

<p>And by four o'clock it certainly was raining a good
deal less, but by four o'clock some eight persons had
assembled in the study and a most exciting discussion
was in progress. Someone from Morgan's had started
a rumour to the effect that Fitzgerald, the vice-captain
of the XV., was going to be dropped out of the side for
the Tonwich match and his place given to Feversham, a
reserve centre from James's. It was a startling piece of
news, that had to be discussed from every point of
view.</p>

<p>First of all, would the side be improved? A doubtful
matter. Fitzgerald had certainly been out of form this
season, and he had played miserably in the last two
matches, but he had experience; he would not be likely
to lose his head in a big game, and Feversham, well,
it would be his first school match. Altogether a doubtful
issue, and, granted even that Feversham was better
than Fitzgerald, would it be worth while in the long
run to leave out the vice-captain and head of
Buxton's? Would it be doing a good service to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Fernhurst football? Buxton's was the athletic house;
it had six school colours. The prestige of Fernhurst
depended a good deal on the prestige of Buxton's.
Surely the prestige of Buxton's was more important
than a problematic improvement in the three-quarter
line.</p>

<p>They argued it out for a quarter of an hour and then,
just when the last point had been brought forward, and
Roland had begun to feel that he was left with no
possible excuse for not going down to the field, the tea
arrived; and after that what chance did he stand? By
the time tea was over it was nearly five o'clock. Choir
practice would have started in a quarter of an hour: if
he wanted to, he could not have gone down then. A bad
business. But it had been a pleasant afternoon; it was
raining like blazes still; very likely the ground would
be again too wet for play to-morrow, and he would cut
the walk and get his boots mended. No doubt things
would pan out all right.</p>

<p>Things, however, did not on this occasion adapt
themselves to Roland's wishes. The rain stopped
shortly after eight o'clock; a violent wind shrieked all
night along the cloisters; next morning the violent
wind was accompanied by bright sunshine; by half-past
two the ground was almost dry. Roland played
in his unstudded boots, and, as he had expected, the
projecting hundredth of an inch sank deeply into his
toe. Three days later he was sent up to the sanatorium
with a poisoned foot.</p>

<p>And in the sanatorium he found himself in the same
ward and alone with Howard, who was recovering from
an attack of "flu" that had been incorrectly diagnosed
as measles.</p>

<p>It was the first time they had met since the first
evening of the term.</p>

<p class="subtitle">THE OUTCOME</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">When</span> two people are left alone together all
day, with no amusement except their own
conversation, they naturally become intimate,
and as the episode of the dance was the only bond of
interest between Howard and Roland they turned to it
at once. As soon as the matron had gone out of the
room Howard asked if he had been forgiven.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, a long time ago; it was a jolly rag."</p>

<p>"Seen anything of your girl since then?"</p>

<p>"Heavens! no. Have you?"</p>

<p>"I should jolly well think so; one doesn't let a thing
like that slip through one's fingers in a hurry. I go out
with her every Sunday, and as likely as not once or
twice during the week."</p>

<p>Roland was struck with surprise and admiration.</p>

<p>"But how on earth do you manage it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's quite easy: in our house anyone can get
out who wants to. The old man never spots anything.
I just heave on a cap and mackintosh, meet her behind
the Abbey and we go for a stroll along the Slopes."</p>

<p>Roland could not ask too many questions and
Howard was only too ready to answer them. He had
seldom enjoyed such a splendid audience. He was not
thought much of in the school, and to tell the truth he
was not much of a fellow. He had absorbed the worst
characteristics of a bad house. He would probably
after he had left spend his evenings hanging about
private bars and the stage doors of second-class music
halls. But he was an interesting companion in the
sanatorium, and he and Roland discussed endlessly
the eternally fascinating subject of girls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"The one thing that you must never do with a girl
is to be shy," Howard said. "That's the one fatal
thing that she'll never forgive. You can do anything
you like with any girl if only you go the right way about
it. She doesn't care whether you are good-looking or
rich or clever, but if she feels that you know more than
she does, that she can trust herself in your hands....
It's all personality. If a girl tries to push you away
when you kiss her, don't worry her, kiss her again;
she only wants to be persuaded; she'd despise you if
you stopped; girls are weak themselves, so they hate
weakness. You can take it from me, Whately, that
girls are an easy game when you know the way to treat
them. It would surprise you if you could only know
what they were thinking. You'll see them sitting at
your father's table, so demure, with their 'Yes, Mr
Howard,' and their 'No, Mr Howard.' You'd think
they'd stepped out of the pages of a fairy book, and yet
get those same girls alone, and in the right mood, my
word...."</p>

<p>Inflammatory, suggestive stuff: the pimp in embryo.</p>

<p>And Roland was one of those on whom such persons
thrive. He had always kept straight at school; he
was not clever nor imaginative, but he was ambitious:
and he had realised early that if he wanted to become a
power in the school he must needs be a success at games.
He had kept clear of anything that had seemed likely
to impair his prowess on the field. But it was different
for him here in the sanatorium, with no exercise and
occupation. In a very little while he had become
thoroughly roused. Howard had enjoyed a certain
number of doubtful experiences; had read several of the
books that appear in the advertisements of obscure
French papers as "rare and curious." He had in addition
a good imagination. Within two days Roland's one
idea was to pick up at the first opportunity the threads
of the romance he had so callously flung aside.</p>

<p>"There'll be no difficulty about that, my dear fellow,"
said Howard. "I can easily get Betty to arrange it.
We meet every Sunday, and we have to walk right out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
beyond Cold Harbour. She says she feels a bit lonely
going out all that way by herself. Now suppose she went
out with your girl and you went out with me&mdash;that'ld
be pretty simple, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that would be splendid. Do you think you
could fix it up?"</p>

<p>"As easy as laughing."</p>

<p>"But I shall feel an awful fool," Roland insisted.
"I shan't know what to say or anything."</p>

<p>"Don't you worry about that, my dear fellow; you
just look as if you did and keep your eyes open, and
you'll soon learn; these girls know a lot more than you
would think."</p>

<p>So it was arranged. Roland found by the time his
foot was right again that he had let himself in for a
pretty exacting programme. It had all seemed jolly
enough up at the sanatorium, but when he was back in the
house, and life re-established its old values, he began to
regret it very heartily. He didn't mind going out with
the girl&mdash;that would be quite exciting: besides it was an
experience to which everyone had to come some time or
other&mdash;but he did not look forward to a long walk with
Howard every Sunday afternoon for the rest of the term.</p>

<p>"Whately, old son," he said to his reflection in the
glass as he shaved himself on the next Sunday morning,
"you've made a pretty sanguinary fool of yourself, but
you can't clear out now. You've got to see it through."</p>

<p>It was very awkward though when Anderson ran up
to him in the cloisters with "Hullo, Whately, going out
for a stroll; well, just wait half-a-sec. while I fetch my
hat." Roland had an infernal job getting rid of him.</p>

<p>"But, my dear man," Anderson had protested, "where
on earth are you going? I've always thought you the
piest man in the house. But if it's a smoke I'll watch
you and if it's a drink I'll help you."</p>

<p>"Oh no, it's not that. I'm going out with a man in
Morgan's."</p>

<p>Anderson's mouth emitted a long whistle of surprise.</p>

<p>"So our Whately has deserted his old friends? Ah,
well, when one gets into the XV., I know."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>Roland could see that Anderson was offended.</p>

<p>But it was even worse when he came back to find his
study full of seven indignant sportsmen wanting to
know why on earth he had taken to going out for
walks with "a dirty tick in Morgan's, who was no use
at anything and didn't even wash."</p>

<p>"He's quite a decent chap," said Roland weakly.
"I met him in the san."</p>

<p>"I dare say you did," said Anderson; "we're
not blaming you for that. You couldn't help it.
But those sorts of things, one does try to live
down."</p>

<p>For days he was ragged about it, so much so that he
hadn't the face to say he had been going out with a girl.
Such a statement should be a proud acknowledgment,
not a confession. If ever he said he couldn't go anywhere,
or do something, the invariable retort was, "I
suppose you're going out for a walk with Howard."</p>

<p>The School house was exclusive; it was insular; it
was prepared to allow the possibility of its members
having friends in the outhouses; there were good men
in the outhouses, even in Morgan's. But one had to be
particular, and when it came to Whately, a man of
whom the house was proud, deserting his friends for a
greasy swine in Morgan's who didn't wash, well, the
least one could do was to make the man realise that he
had gone a little far.</p>

<p>It was a bad business, altogether a bad business, and
Roland very much doubted whether the hour and a half
he spent with Dolly was an adequate recompense. She
was a nice girl, quite a nice girl, and they found themselves
on kissing terms quickly enough. There were no
signs of their getting any further, and, as a matter of
fact, if there had been, Roland would have been extremely
alarmed. He objected to awkward situations
and intense emotions: he preferred to keep his life
within the decent borders of routine. He wanted adventure
certainly, but adventure bounded by the limits of
the society in which he lived. He liked to feel that
his day was tabulated and arranged; he hated that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
lost feeling of being unprepared; he liked to know
exactly what he had to say to Dolly before he could hold
her hand and exactly what he had to say before she
would let him kiss her. It was a game that had to be
rehearsed before one got it right; no actor enjoys his
part before he has learnt his words; when he had learnt
the rules it was great fun; kisses were pleasant things.
He wrote a letter to his friend, Ralph Richmond,
acquainting him of this fact.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Ralph</span>,&mdash;Why haven't you written to me,
you lazy swine? I suppose you will say that you're
awfully hard worked, getting ready for Smalls. But I
don't believe it. I know how much I do myself.</p>

<p>It's been quite a decent term. I got my colours and
shall be captain of the house after the summer if the
people I think are going to leave do leave. Think of
me as a ruler of men. I'm having a pretty good slack in
form and don't have to do any work, except in French,
where a fellow called Carus-Evans, an awful swine, has
his knife into me and puts me on whenever we get to a
hard bit. However, as I never do much else I'm able
to swot the French all right.</p>

<p>The great bit of news, though, is that I've met a girl
in the town who I go out for walks with. I'm not
really keen on her, and I think I prefer her friend,
Betty (we go in couples). Betty's much older and she's
dark and she makes you blush when she looks at you.
Still, Dolly's very jolly, and we go out for walks every
Sunday and have great times. She lets me kiss her as
much as I like. Now what do you think of it? Write
and tell me at once. Yours ever,</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Roland</span>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Two days later Roland received the following
reply:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Roland</span>,&mdash;So glad to hear from you again,
and many congratulations on your firsts. I had heard
about them as a matter of fact, and had been meaning
to write to you, but I am very busy just now. April
told me about it; she seemed awfully pleased. I must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>say she was looking jolly pretty; she thinks a lot of
you. Sort of hero. If I were you I should think a bit
more about her and a little less about your Bettys and
Dollys.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to the holidays. We must
manage to have a few good rags somehow. The
Saundersons are giving a dance, so that ought to be
amusing.   Ever yours,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Ralph</span>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Roland's comment on this letter was "Jealous little
beast." He wished he hadn't written to him. And
why drag April in? He and April were great friends;
they always had been. Once they had imagined themselves
sweethearts. When they went out to parties
they had always sat next each other during tea and held
hands under the table; in general post Roland had
often been driven into the centre because of a brilliant
failure to take the chair that was next to hers. They
had kissed sometimes at dances in the shadow of a
passage, and once at a party, when they had been
pulling crackers, he had slipped on to the fourth finger
of her left hand a brass ring that had fallen from the
crumpled paper. She still kept that ring, although
the days of courtship were over. Roland had altered
since he had gone to Fernhurst. But they were great
friends, and there was always an idea between the two
families that the children might eventually marry.
Mr Whately was, indeed, fond of prefacing some
remote speculation about the future with, "By the
time Roland and April are married&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was no need, Roland felt, for Ralph to have
dragged April into the business at all. He was aggrieved,
and the whole business seemed again a waste and an
encumbrance. Was it worth while? He got ragged in
the house, and he had to spend an hour in Howard's
company before he met Dolly at all. Howard was
really rather terrible; so conceited, so familiar; and
now that he had found an audience he indulged it the
whole time. He was at his worst when he attempted
sentiment. Once when they were walking back he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
turned to Roland, in the middle of a soliloquy, with a
gesture of profound disdain and resignation.</p>

<p>"But what's all this after all?" he said. "It's
nothing; it's pleasant; it passes the time, and we
have to have some distractions in this place to keep
us going. But it's not the real thing; there's all the
difference in the world between this and the real thing.
A kiss can be anything or nothing; it can raise one
to&mdash;to any height, or it can be like eating chocolates.
I'm not a chap, you know, who really cares for this
sort of thing. I'm in love. I suppose you are too."</p>

<p>And Roland, who did not want to be outdone, confessed
that there was someone, "a girl he had known
all his life."</p>

<p>"But you don't want a girl you've known all your
life; love's not a thing that we drift into; it must be
sudden; it must be unexpected; it must hurt."</p>

<p>Howard was a sore trial, and it was with the most
unutterable relief that Roland learned that he was
leaving at Christmas to go to a crammer's.</p>

<p>"We must keep up with one another, old fellow,"
Howard said on their last Sunday. "You must come
and lunch with me one day in town. Write and tell
me all about it. We've had some jolly times."</p>

<p>Roland caught a glimpse of him on the last day,
resplendent in an O.F. scarf, very loud and hearty,
saying "good-bye" to people he had hardly spoken
to before. "You'll write to me, won't you, old
fellow? Come and lunch with me when you're up in
town. The Regent Club. Good-bye." Since his first
year, when the prefect for whom he had fagged, and by
whom he had been beaten several times, had left,
Roland had never been so heartily thankful to see any
member of the school in old boys' colours.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a></h3>

<p class="subtitle">RALPH AND APRIL</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Ralph Richmond</span> was the son of an emotional
woman and he had read too many novels. He
took himself seriously: without being religious,
he considered that it was the duty of every man to
leave the world better than he found it. Such a philosophy
may be natural to a man of thirty-six who sees
small prospect of realising his own ambition, and resorts
to the consolation of a collective enthusiasm, but it is
abnormal in a boy of seventeen, an age which usually
sees itself in the stalls of a theatre waiting for the curtain
to rise and reveal a stage set with limitless opportunities
for self-development and self-indulgence.</p>

<p>But Ralph had been brought up in an atmosphere
of ideals; at the age of seven he gave a performance of
<cite>Hamlet</cite> in the nursery, and in the same year he visited
a lenten performance of <cite>Everyman</cite>. At his preparatory
school he came under the influence of an empire builder,
who used to appeal to the emotions of his form. "The
future of the country is in your hands," he would say.
"One day you will be at the helm. You must prepare
yourselves for that time. You must never forget."
And Ralph did not. He thought of himself as the
arbiter of destinies. He felt that till that day his life
must be a vigil. Like the knights of Arthurian romance,
he would watch beside his armour in the chapel. In
the process he became a prig, and on his last day at
Rycroft Lodge he became a prude. His headmaster
gave all the boys who were leaving a long and serious
address on the various temptations of the flesh to which
they would be subjected at their Public Schools. Ralph
had no clear idea of what these temptations might be.
Their results, however, seemed sufficient reason for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
abstention. If he yielded to them, he gathered that
he would lose in a short time his powers of thought, his
strength, his moral stamina; a slow poison would devour
him; in a few years he would be mad and blind and
probably, though of this he was not quite certain, deaf
as well. At any rate he would be in a condition when
the ability of detecting sound would be of slight value.
These threats were alarming: their effect, however,
would not have been lasting in the case of Ralph, who
was no coward and also, being no fool, would have soon
observed that this process of disintegration was not
universal in its application. No; it was not the threat
that did the damage: it was the romantic appeal of the
headmaster's peroration.</p>

<p>"After all," he said, after a dramatic pause, "how
can any one of you who has been a filthy beast at school
dare to propose marriage to some pure, clean woman?"</p>

<p>That told; that sentiment was within the range of
his comprehension; it was a beautiful idea, a chivalrous
idea, worthy, he inappropriately imagined, of Sir
Lancelot. He could understand that a knight should
come to his lady with glittering armour and an unstained
sword. At the time he did not fully appreciate
the application of this image: he soon learnt, however,
that a night spent on one's knees on the stone floor
of a draughty chapel is a cold and lonely prelude to
enchantment: a discovery that did not make him the
more charitable to those who preferred clean linen and
soft down.</p>

<p>It was only to be supposed, therefore, that he would
receive Roland's confidences with disgust. He had
always felt a little jealous of April's obvious preference
for his friend, but he had regarded it as the fortune of
war and had taken what pleasure he might in the part
of confidant. To this vicarious excitant their intimacy
indeed owed its strength. His indignation, therefore,
when he learnt of Roland's rustic courtship was only
exceeded by his positive fury when, on the first evening
of the holidays, he went round to see the Curtises and
found there Roland and his father. It was the height of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
hypocrisy. He had supposed that Roland would at
least have the decency to keep away from her. It had
been bad enough to give up a decent girl for a shop
assistant, but to come back and carry on as though
nothing had happened.... It was monstrous, cruel,
unthinkable. And there was April, so clean and calm,
with her thick brown hair gathered up in a loop across
her forehead; her eyes, deep and gentle, with subdued
colours, brown and a shade of green, and that delicate
smile of simple trust and innocence, smiling at him,
ignorant of how she had been deceived.</p>

<p>It must be set down, however, to Roland's credit
that he had felt a few qualms about going round at once
to see the Curtises. Less than twenty-four hours had
passed since he had held Dolly's hand and protested to
her an undying loyalty. He did not love her; the
words meant nothing, and they both knew it; they were
merely part of the convention of the game. Nor for
that matter was he in love with April&mdash;at least he did
not think he was. He owed nothing to either of them.
But conscience told him that, in view of the understanding
that was supposed to exist between them, it would
be more proper to wait a day or two. After all, one did
not go to a theatre the day after one's father's funeral,
however eagerly one's imagination had anticipated the
event.</p>

<p>Things had, however, turned out otherwise. At a
quarter to six Mr Whately returned from town. He
was the manager of a bank, at a salary of seven hundred
and fifty pounds a year, an income that allowed the
family to visit the theatre, upper circle seats, at least
once every holidays and provided Roland with as much
pocket-money as he needed. Mr Whately walked into
the drawing-room, greeted his son with the conventional
joke about a holiday task, handed his wife a copy of
<cite>The Globe</cite>, sat down in front of the fire and began to
take off his boots.</p>

<p>"Nothing much in the papers to-day, my dear. Not
much happening anywhere as a matter of fact. I had
lunch to-day with Robinson and he called it the lull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
before the storm. I shouldn't be a bit surprised if he
wasn't right. You can't trust these Radicals."</p>

<p>He was a scrubby little man: for thirty years he had
worked in the same house: there had been no friction
and no excitement in his life: he had by now lost any
independence of thought and action.</p>

<p>"I've just found a splendid place, my dear, where
you can get a really first-class lunch for one-and-sixpence."</p>

<p>"Have you, dear?"</p>

<p>"Yes; in Soho, just behind the Palace. I went there
to-day with Robinson. We had four courses, and cheese
to finish up with. Something like."</p>

<p>"And was it well cooked, dear?"</p>

<p>"Rather; the plaice was beautifully fried. Just
beginning to brown."</p>

<p>His face flushed with a genuine animation. Change
of food was the only adventure that life brought to him.
He rose slowly.</p>

<p>"Well, I must go up and change, I suppose. I've
one or two other things to tell you, dear, later on."</p>

<p>He did not ask his wife what she had been doing
during the day; it was indeed doubtful whether he
appreciated the existence of any life at 105 Hammerton
Villas, Hammerton, during the hours when he was
away from them. Himself was the central point.</p>

<p>Five minutes later he came down stairs in a light suit.</p>

<p>"Well, who's coming out with me for a constitutional?"</p>

<p>Roland got up, walked into the hall, picked up his
hat and stick.</p>

<p>"Right you are, father; I'm ready."</p>

<p>It was the same thing every day. At eight-thirty-five
Mr Whately caught a bus at the corner of the High
Street. He had never been known to miss it. On the
rare occasions when he was a few seconds late the driver
would wait till he saw the panting little figure come
running round the corner, trying to look dignified in
spite of the top hat that bobbed from one side of his
head to the other. From nine o'clock till a quarter-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>past five Mr Whately worked at a desk, with an hour's
interval for lunch. Every evening he went for an
hour's walk; for half-an-hour before dinner he read the
evening paper. After dinner he would play a game of
patience and smoke his pipe. Occasionally a friend
would drop in for a chat; very occasionally he would
go out himself. At ten o'clock sharp he went to bed.
Every Saturday afternoon he attended a public performance
of either cricket or football according to the
season. Roland often wondered how he could stand it.
What had he to look forward to? What did he think
about when he sat over the fire puffing at his pipe. And
his mother. How monotonous her life appeared to
him. Yet she seemed always happy enough: she never
grumbled. Roland could not understand it. Whatever
happened, he would take jolly good care that he never
ran into a groove like that. They had loved each other
well enough once, he supposed, but now&mdash;oh, well, love
was the privilege of youth.</p>

<p>Father and son walked in silence. They were fond
of each other; they liked being together; Mr Whately
was very proud of his son's achievements; but their
affection was never expressed in words. After a while
they began to talk of indifferent things, guessing at
each other's thoughts: a relationship of intuitions.
They passed along the High Street and, turning behind
the shops, walked down a long street of small red-brick
villas with stucco fronts.</p>

<p>"Don't you think we ought to go in and see the
Curtises?" Mr Whately asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I hadn't meant to. I thought...."</p>

<p>"I think you ought to, you know, your first day;
they'd be rather offended if you didn't. April asked
me when you were coming back."</p>

<p>And so Roland was bound to abandon his virtuous
resolution.</p>

<p>It was not a particularly jolly evening before Ralph
arrived. Afterwards it was a good deal worse.</p>

<p>In the old days, when father and son had paid an
evening visit, Roland had run straight up to the nursery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
and enjoyed himself, but now he had to sit in the
drawing-room, which was a very different matter. He
did not like Mrs Curtis: he never had liked her, but
she had not troubled him in the days when she had been
a mere voice below the banisters. Now he had to sit
in the small drawing-room, with its shut windows, and
hear her voice cleave through the clammy atmosphere
in languid, pathetic cadences; a sentimental voice,
and under the sentiment a hard, cold cruelty. Her
person was out of keeping with her voice; it should
have been plump and comfortable-looking; instead it
was tall, thin, angular, all over points, like a hat-rack
in a restaurant: a terrible bedfellow. And she talked,
heavens! how she talked. It was usually about her
children.</p>

<p>"Dear Arthur, he's getting on so well at school. Do
you know what his headmaster said about him in his
report?"</p>

<p>"Oh, but, mother, please," Arthur would protest.</p>

<p>"No, dear, be quiet: I know Mr Whately would
like to hear. The headmaster said, Mr Whately...."
Then it was her daughter's turn. "And April too,
Mr Whately, she's getting on so well with her drawing
lessons. Mr Hamilton was only saying to me
yesterday...."</p>

<p>It was not surprising that Roland was less keen now
on going round there. It was little fun for him after all
to sit and listen while she talked, to see his father so
utterly complacent, with his "Yes, Mrs Curtis," and
his "Really, Mrs Curtis," and to look at poor April
huddled in the window-seat, so bored, so ashamed, her
eyes meeting his with a look that said: "Don't worry
about her, don't take any notice of what she says. I'm
not like that." Once or twice he tried to talk to her,
but it was no use: her mother would interrupt, would
bring them back into the circle of her own egotism.
In her own drawing-room she would tolerate nothing
independent of herself.</p>

<p>"Yes, Roland; what was it you were saying? The
Saundersons' dance? Of course April will be going.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
They're very old friends of ours, the Saundersons. Mr
Saunderson thinks such a lot of Arthur too. You know,
Mr Whately, I met him in the High Street the other
afternoon and he said to me, 'How's that clever son of
yours getting on, Mrs Curtis?'"</p>

<p>"Really, Mrs Curtis."</p>

<p>"Yes, really, Mr Whately."</p>

<p>It was at this point that Ralph arrived.</p>

<p>His look of surprised displeasure was obvious to
everyone. But knowing Ralph, they mistook it for
awkwardness. He did not like company, and his
shyness was apparent as he stood in the doorway
in an ill-fitting suit, with trousers that bagged at the
knees, and with the front part of his hair smarmed
across his forehead with one hurried sweep of a damp
brush, at right angles to the rest of his hair, that fell
perpendicularly from the crown of his head.</p>

<p>"Come along, Ralph," said April, and made room for
him in the window-seat. She treated him with an
amused condescension. He was so clumsy; a dear
fellow, so easy to rag. "And how did your exam. go?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>"No; but really, tell me about it. What were the
maths like?"</p>

<p>"Not so bad."</p>

<p>"And the geography? You were so nervous about
that."</p>

<p>"I didn't do badly."</p>

<p>"And the Latin and the Greek? I want to know all
about it."</p>

<p>"You don't, really?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I do."</p>

<p>"No, you don't," he said impatiently. "You'd
much rather hear about Roland and all the things he
does at Fernhurst."</p>

<p>There was a moment of difficult silence, then
April said quite quietly:</p>

<p>"You are quite right, Ralph; as a matter of fact I
should"; and she turned towards Roland, but before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
she could say anything, Mrs Curtis once more assumed
her monopoly of the conversation.</p>

<p>"Yes, Roland, you've told us nothing about that,
and how you got your firsts. We were so proud of you
too. And you never wrote to tell us. If it hadn't been
for your father we should never have known." And for
the next half-hour her voice flowed on placidly, while
Ralph sat in a frenzy of self-pity and self-contempt,
and Roland longed for an opportunity to kick him,
and April looked out between the half-drawn curtains
towards the narrow line of sky that lay darkly
over the long stretch of roofs and chimney-pots, happy
that Roland's holidays had begun, regretting wistfully
that childhood was finished for them, that they could
no longer play their own games in the nursery, that
they had become part of the ambitions of their parents.</p>

<p>When at last they rose to go, Ralph lingered for a
moment in the doorway; he could not go home till
April had forgiven him.</p>

<p>She stood on the top of the step, looking down the
street to Roland, her heart still beating a little quickly,
still disturbed by that pressure of the hand and that
sudden uncomfortable meeting of the eyes when he had
said "Good-bye." She did not notice Ralph till he
began to speak to her.</p>

<p>"I am awfully sorry I was so rude to you, April. I'm
rather tired. I didn't mean to offend you. I wouldn't
have done it for worlds."</p>

<p>She turned to him with a quiet smile.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't worry about that," she said, "that's
nothing."</p>

<p>And he could see that to her it was indeed nothing,
that she had not thought twice about it. That nothing
he said or did was of the least concern to her. He would
much rather that she had been angry.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Next day Ralph came round to the Whatelys' soon
after breakfast.</p>

<p>"Well, feeling more peaceful to-day, old friend?"
Ralph looked at Roland in impotent annoyance. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
he knew of old, Roland was an impossible person to
have a row with. He simply would not fight. He
either agreed to everything you said or else brushed
away your arguments with a good-natured "All right,
old man, all right!" On this occasion, however, he
felt that he must make a stand.</p>

<p>"You're the limit," he said; "the absolute limit."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that, but I think you were last
night."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't joke about it. You know what I mean.
I think it's pretty rotten for a fellow like you to go about
with a shop-assistant, but that's not really the thing.
What's simply beastly is your coming back to April as
though nothing had happened. What would she say
if she knew?"</p>

<p>Roland refused to acknowledge omniscience. "I
don't know," he said.</p>

<p>"She wouldn't be pleased, would she?" Ralph persisted.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose so."</p>

<p>"No; well then, there you are; you oughtn't to do
anything you think she mightn't like."</p>

<p>Roland looked at him with a sad patience, as a preparatory
schoolmaster at a refractory infant.</p>

<p>"But, my dear fellow, we're not married, and we're
not engaged. Surely we can do more or less what we
like."</p>

<p>"But would you be pleased if you learned that she'd
been carrying on with someone else?"</p>

<p>Roland admitted that he would not.</p>

<p>"Then why should you think you owe nothing to
her?"</p>

<p>"It's different, my dear Ralph; it's quite different."</p>

<p>"No, it isn't."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is. Boys can do things that girls can't. A
flirtation means very little to a boy; it means a good
deal to a girl&mdash;at least it ought to. If it doesn't, it
means that she's had too much of it."</p>

<p>"But I don't see&mdash;&mdash;" began Ralph.</p>

<p>"Come on, come on; don't let's go all over that again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
We shall never agree. Let me go my way and you can
go yours. We are too old friends to quarrel about a
thing like this."</p>

<p>Most boys would have been annoyed by Ralph's
attempt at interference, but it took a great deal to
ruffle Roland's lazy, equable good nature. He did not
believe in rows. He liked to keep things running
smoothly. He could never understand the people who
were always wanting to stir up trouble. He did not
really care enough either way. His tolerance might
have been called indifference, but it possessed, at any
rate, a genuine charm. The other fellow always felt
what a thundering good chap Roland was&mdash;so good-tempered,
such a gentleman, never harbouring a grievance.
People knew where they were with him; when
he said a thing was over it was over.</p>

<p>"All right," said Ralph grudgingly. "I don't know
that it's quite the game&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't worry. We're a long way from anything
serious. A good deal's got to happen before we're
come to the age when we can't do what we like."</p>

<p>And they talked of other things.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a></h3>

<p class="subtitle">A KISS</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">April</span> sat for a long while before the looking-glass
wondering whether to tie a blue or a white
ribbon in her hair. She tried one and then
the other and paused irresolute. It was the evening of
the Saundersons' dance, to which for weeks she had been
looking forward, and she was desperately anxious to
look pretty. It would be a big affair: ices and claret-cup
and a band, and Roland would be there. They
had seen a lot of each other during the holidays&mdash;nearly
every day. Often they had felt awkward in each
other's company; there had been embarrassing
silences, when their eyes would meet suddenly and
quickly turn away; and then there would come an unexpected
interlude of calm, harmonious friendship, when
they would talk openly and naturally to each other and
would sit afterwards for a long while silent, softened
and tranquillised by the presence of some unknown
influence&mdash;moments of rare gentleness and sympathy.
April could not help feeling that they were on the
edge of something definite, some incident of avowal.
She did not know what, but she felt that something
was about to happen. She was flustered and expectant
and eager to look pretty for Roland on this great
evening.</p>

<p>She had chosen a very simple dress, a white muslin
frock, that left bare her arms and throat, and was
trimmed with pale blue ribbon at the neck and elbow;
her stockings, too, were white, but her shoes and her
sash a vivid, unexpected scarlet. She turned round
slowly before the glass and smiled happily at her clear,
fresh girlhood, tossing back her head, so that her hair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
was shaken out over her shoulders. Surely he would
think her beautiful to-night. With eager fingers she
tied the blue ribbon in her hair, turned again slowly
before the glass, smiled, shook out her hair, and laughed
happily. Yes, she would wear the blue&mdash;a subdued,
quiet colour, that faded naturally into the warm brown.
She ran downstairs for her family's approval, stood
before her mother and turned a slow circle.</p>

<p>"Well, mother?"</p>

<p>Mrs Curtis examined her critically.</p>

<p>"Of course, dear, I'm quite certain that you'll be the
prettiest girl there whatever you wear."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, mother?"</p>

<p>"Well, April dear, of course I know you think you
know best, but that white frock&mdash;it is so very simple."</p>

<p>"But simple things suit me, mother."</p>

<p>"I know they do, dear; you look sweet in anything;
but at a big dance like this, where there'll be so many
smart people, they might think&mdash;well, I don't know,
dear, but it is very quiet, isn't it?"</p>

<p>The moment before April had been happy and
excited, and now she was crushed and humiliated. She
sat down on the edge of a chair, gazing with pathetic
pity at her brilliant shoes.</p>

<p>"You've spoilt it all," she said.</p>

<p>"No, dear. I'm sure you'll be thankful to me when
you get there. Now, why don't you run upstairs and
put on that nice mauve frock of yours?"</p>

<p>April shook her shoulders.</p>

<p>"I don't like mauve."</p>

<p>"Well then, dear, there's the green and yellow; you
always look nice in that."</p>

<p>It was a bright affair that her mother had seen at a
sale in Brixton and bought at once because it was so
cheap. It had never really suited April, whose delicate
features needed a simple setting; but her mother did
not like to feel that she had made a mistake, and having
persuaded herself that the green and yellow was the
right colour, and matched her daughter's eyes, had
insisted on April's wearing it as often as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, my dear, the green and yellow. I'm sure I'm
right. Now hurry up; the cab will be here in ten
minutes."</p>

<p>April walked upstairs slowly. She hated that green
and yellow; she always had hated it. She took it
down from the wardrobe and, holding the ends of the
sleeves, stretched out her arms on either side so that the
green and yellow dress covered her completely, and
then she stood looking at it in the glass.</p>

<p>How blatant, how decorative it was, with its bows
and ribbons and slashed sleeves. There were some girls
whom it would suit&mdash;big girls with high complexions
and full figures. But it wasn't her dress, it spoilt her.
She let it slip from her fingers; it fell rustling to the
floor, and once again the glass reflected her in a plain
white frock, and once again she tossed back her head,
and once again the slow smile of satisfaction played
across her lips. And as she stood there with outstretched
arms, for one inspired moment of revelation,
during which the beating of her heart was stilled, she
saw how beautiful she would one day be to the man
for whom with such a gesture she would be delivered
to his love. A deep flush coloured her neck and face,
a flush of triumphant pride, of wakening womanhood.
Then with a quick, impatient movement of
her scarlet shoes she kicked the yellow dress away
from her.</p>

<p>Why should she wear it? She dressed to please herself
and not her mother. She knew best what suited
her. What would happen if she disobeyed her?
Would anyone ever know? She could manage to slip
out when no one was looking. Annie would be sent to
fetch her, but they would come back after everyone had
gone to bed.</p>

<p>She sat on the edge of her bed and toyed with the
thought of rebellion. It would be horribly exciting.
It would be the naughtiest thing she had done in her
life. She had never yet disobeyed deliberately anyone
who had authority over her. She had lost her temper
in the nursery; she had been insolent to her nurses;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
she had pretended not to hear when she had been called;
but never this: never had she sat down and decided in
cold blood to disregard authority.</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door.</p>

<p>"Yes. Who's that?"</p>

<p>"It's only me&mdash;mother. Can I help you, dear?"</p>

<p>"No thank you, mother, I'm all right."</p>

<p>"Quite sure?"</p>

<p>"Quite."</p>

<p>April heard her mother slowly descend the stairs,
then heaved a sigh of half-proud, half-guilty relief.
She was glad she had managed to get out of it without
actually telling a lie. She sat still and waited, till at
last she heard the crunch of a cab drawing up outside
the house. She wrapped herself tightly in her coat,
tiptoed to the door, opened it and listened. She could
hear her mother's voice in the passage. Quietly she
stole out on to the landing, quietly ran downstairs and
across the hall, fumbled for the door handle, found
it, turned it, and pulled it quickly behind her. It
was done; she was free. As she ran down the steps
she heard a window open behind her and her mother's
voice:</p>

<p>"Who's that? What is it? Oh, you, April. You
might have come to see me before you went. A happy
evening to you."</p>

<p>April could not trust herself to speak; she ran down
the steps, jumped into the cab and sank back into the
corner of the cushioned seat. Her breath came quickly
and unevenly, her breasts heaved and fell. She could
have almost cried with excitement.</p>

<p>It had been worth it, though. She knew that beyond
doubt a quarter of an hour later, when she walked into
the ballroom and saw the look of sudden admiration
that came into Roland's eyes when he saw her for the
first time across the room. He came straight over to her.</p>

<p>"How many dances may I have?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Well, there's No. 11."</p>

<p>"No. 11? Let me have a look at your card."</p>

<p>"No, of course you mustn't."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, of course. Why, I don't believe you have
got one!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have," she said, and held it up to him. In
a second it was in his hand, as indeed she had intended
that it should be.</p>

<p>"Well, now," said Roland, "as far as I can see
you've got only Nos. 6, 7, 14 and 15 engaged; that
leaves fourteen for me."</p>

<p>"Well, you can have the four," she laughed.</p>

<p>In the end she gave him six. "And if I've any over
you shall have them," she promised.</p>

<p>"Well you know there won't be," and their eyes met
in a moment of quiet intimacy.</p>

<p>As soon as he had gone other partners crowded round
her. In a very short while her programme was filled
right up, the five extras as well. She had left No. 17
vacant; it was the last waltz. She felt that she might
like Roland to have it, but was not sure. She didn't
quite know why, but she felt she would leave it
open.</p>

<p>It was a splendid dance. As the evening passed, her
face flushed and her eyes brightened, and it was delightful
to slip from the heat of the ballroom on to the wide
balcony and feel the cool of the air on her bare arms.
She danced once with Ralph, and as they sat out afterwards
she could almost feel the touch of his eyes on
her. Poor Ralph; he was so clumsy. How absurd it
was of him to be in love with her. As if she could ever
care for him. She felt no pity. She accepted his
admiration as a queen accepts a subject's loyalty; it
was the right due to her beauty, to the eager flow of
life that sustained her on this night of triumph.</p>

<p>And every dance with Roland seemed to bring her
nearer to the wonderful moment to which she had so
long looked forward. When she was dancing with
Ralph, Roland's eyes would follow her all round the
room, smiling when they met hers. And when they
danced together they seemed to share a secret with one
another, a secret still unrevealed.</p>

<p>Through the languid ecstasy of a waltz the words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
that he murmured into her ear had no relation with
their accepted sense. He was not repeating a piece of
trivial gossip, a pun, a story he had heard at school;
he was wooing her in their own way, in their own time.
And afterwards as they sat on the edge of the balcony,
looking out over the roofs and lights of London, she
began to tell him about her dress and the trouble that
she had had with her mother. "She said I ought to
wear a horrid thing with yellow and green stripes that
doesn't suit me in the least. And I wouldn't. I stole
out of the house when she wasn't looking."</p>

<p>"You look wonderful to-night," he said.</p>

<p>He leant forward and their hands touched; his little
finger intertwined itself round hers. She felt his warm
breath upon her face.</p>

<p>"Do I?" she whispered. "It's all for you."</p>

<p>In another moment he would have taken her in his
arms and kissed her, and she would have responded
naturally. They had reached that moment to which
the course of the courtship had tended, that point when
a kiss is involuntary, that point that can never come
again. But just as his hands stretched out to her the
band struck up; he rested his hand on hers and
pressed it.</p>

<p>"We shall have to go," he whispered.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But the next but one."</p>

<p>"No. 16."</p>

<p>But the magic of that one moment had passed; they
had left behind them the possibility of spontaneous
action. They were no longer part of the natural
rhythm of their courtship. All through the next
dance he kept saying to himself: "I shall have to kiss
her the next time. I shall. I know I shall. I must
pull myself together." He felt puzzled, frightened and
excited, so that when the time came he was both
nervous and self-conscious. The magic had gone, yet
each felt that something was expected of them. Roland
tried to pull himself together; to remind himself that if
he didn't kiss her now she would never forgive him;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
that there was nothing in it; that he had kissed Dolly
a hundred times and thought nothing of it. But it was
not the same thing; that was shallow and trivial;
this was genuine; real emotion was at stake. He did
not know what to do. As they sat out after the
dance he tried to make a bet with himself, to say,
"I'll count ten and then I'll do it." He stretched
out his hand to hers, and it lay in his limp and
uninspired.</p>

<p>"April," he whispered, "April."</p>

<p>She turned her head from him. He leant forward,
hesitated for a moment, then kissed her awkwardly
upon the neck. She did not move. He felt he must
do something. He put his arm round her, trying to turn
her face to his, but she pulled away from him. He
tried to kiss her, and his chin scratched the soft skin
of her cheek, his nose struck hers, her mouth half
opened, and her teeth jarred against his lips. It was a
failure, a dismal failure.</p>

<p>She pushed him away angrily.</p>

<p>"Go away! go away!" she said. "What are you
doing? What do you mean by it? I hate you; go
away!"</p>

<p>All the excitement of the evening turned into violent
hatred; she was half hysterical. She had been worked
up to a point, and had been let down. She was not
angry with him because he had tried to kiss her, but
because he had chosen the wrong moment, because he
had failed to move her.</p>

<p>"But, April, I'm sorry, April."</p>

<p>"Oh, go away; leave me alone, leave me alone."</p>

<p>"But, April." He put his hand upon her arm, and
she swung round upon him fiercely.</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you I wanted to be left alone. I
don't know how you dared. Do leave me."</p>

<p>She walked quickly past him into the ballroom, and
seeing Ralph at the far end of it went up and asked
him, to that young gentleman's exhilarated amazement,
whether he was free for No. 17, and if he was whether
he would like to dance it with her. She wore a brave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
smile through the rest of the evening and danced all her
five extras.</p>

<p>But when she was home again, had climbed the
silent stairs, and turning up the light in her bedroom
saw, lying on the floor, the discarded green and yellow
dress, she broke down, and flinging herself upon the
bed sobbed long and bitterly. She was not angry with
Roland, nor her mother, nor even with herself, but with
life, with that cruel force that had filled her with such eager
boundless expectation, only in the end to fling her down,
to trample on her happiness, to mock her disenchantment.
Never as long as she lived would she forget the
shame, the unspeakable shame, and degradation of that
evening.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a></h3>
<p class="subtitle">A POTENTIAL DIPLOMAT</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Roland</span> returned to school with the uncomfortable
feeling that he had not made the most of
his holidays. He had failed with April; he
had not been on the best of terms with Ralph; and he
had found the last week or so&mdash;after the Saundersons'
dance&mdash;a little tedious. He was never sorry to go back
to school; on this occasion he was positively glad.</p>

<p>In many ways the Easter term was the best of the
three; it was agreeably short; there were the house
matches, the steeplechases, the sports and then, at the
end of it, spring; those wonderful mornings at the end
of March when one woke to see the courts vivid with
sunshine, the lindens trembling on the verge of green;
when one thought of the summer and cricket and
bathing and the long, cool evenings. And as Howard
had now left, there was nothing to molest his enjoyment
of these good things.</p>

<p>He decided, after careful deliberation, to keep it up
with Dolly. There had been moments during the
holidays when he had sworn to break with her; it
would be quite easy now that Howard had left. And
often during an afternoon in April's company the idea
of embracing Dolly had been repulsive to him. But he
had been piqued by April's behaviour at the dance, and
his conduct was not ordered by a carefully-thought-out
code of morals. He responded to the atmosphere of
the moment; his emotion, while the moment that
inspired it lasted, was sincere.</p>

<p>And so every Sunday afternoon he used to bicycle
out towards Yeovil and meet Dolly on the edge of a
little wood. They would wheel their machines inside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
and sit together in the shelter of the hedge. They did
not talk much; there was not much for them to discuss.
But she would take off her hat and lean her head against
his shoulder and let him kiss her as much as he wanted.
She was not responsive, but then Roland hardly expected
it. His small experience of the one-sided
romances of school life had led him to believe that love
was a thing of male desire and gracious, womanly compliance.
He never thought that anyone would want
to kiss him. He would look at his reflection in the glass
and marvel at the inelegance of his features&mdash;an ordinary
face with ordinary eyes, ordinary nose, ordinary mouth.
Of his hair certainly he was proud; it was a triumph.
But he doubted whether Dolly appreciated the care
with which he had trained it to lie back from his forehead
in one immaculate wave. She had, indeed, asked
him to give up brilliantine.</p>

<p>"It's so hard and smarmy," she complained; "I
can't run my fingers through it."</p>

<p>The one good point about him was certainly lost on
Dolly. He wondered whether April liked it. April
and Dolly! It was hard to think of the two together.
What would April say if she were to hear about Dolly?
It was the theme Ralph was always driving at him like
a nail, with heavy, ponderous blows. An interesting
point. What would April say? He considered the
question, not as a possible criticism of his own conduct,
but as the material for an intriguing, dramatic situation.
It would be hard to make her see the difference. "I'm
a girl and she's a girl and you want to kiss us both."
That was how she would look at it, probably&mdash;so
illogical. One might as well say that water was the
same thing and had the same effect as champagne.
Ridiculous! But it would be hard to make April
see it.</p>

<p>And there was a difference, a big difference; he felt
it before a fortnight of the new term had passed. In
spite of the kisses he was never moved by Dolly's
presence as he was by April's. His blood was calm&mdash;calmer,
far calmer, than it had been last term. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
never felt now that excitement, that dryness of the
throat that used to assail him in morning chapel towards
the end of the Litany. Something had passed,
and it was not solely April, though, no doubt, she had
formed a standard in his mind and had her share in this
disenchantment. It was more than that. In a subtle
way, although he had hardly exchanged a dozen words
with her in his life, he missed Betty. He had enjoyed
more than he had realised at the time those moments of
meeting and parting, when the four of them had stood
together, awkward, embarrassed, waiting for someone
to suggest a separation. It had always been Betty who
had done it, with a toss of her head: "Come on, Dolly,
time to be getting on"; or else: "Now then, Dolly,
isn't it time you were taking your Roland away with
you?" And what a provocative, infinitely suggestive
charm that slow smile of hers had held for him. The
thrill of it had borne him triumphantly over the preliminaries
of courtship. He missed it now, and often
he found himself talking of her to Dolly.</p>

<p>"Did she really like Howard?" he asked her once.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so; in fact, I know she did. Though
I couldn't see what she saw in him myself. I suppose
there was something about him. She misses him quite
a lot, so she says."</p>

<p>This statement Roland considered an excellent cue
for an exchange of gallantries.</p>

<p>"But wouldn't you miss me if I went?"</p>

<p>Dolly, however, was interested in her own subject.</p>

<p>"Yes," she went on, "she seems really worried.
Only the other day she said to me: 'Dolly, I can't get
on without that boy. There's nothing to look forward
to of a Sunday now, and I get so tired of my work.'
And when I said to her: 'But, my dear Betty,
there's hundreds more fish in the sea. What about
young Rogers at the post office?' she answers:
'Oh, him! my boy's spoilt me for all that. I can't
bear the sight of young Rogers any more.' Funny,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>Roland agreed with her. To him it was amazing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," Dolly went on, "I saw quite clearly that
there was nothing for it but that she must get hold of
another young chap like your friend. And I asked her
if there was anyone else up at the school she fancied,
and she said, yes, there was; a boy she's seen you
talking to once or twice; a young, fair-haired fellow
with a blue and yellow hat ribbon. That's the best I
can do. Is that any help to you? Would you know
him?"</p>

<p>A blue and yellow hat ribbon limited the selection to
members of the School XI., and there was only one old
colour who answered to that description&mdash;Brewster in
Carus Evans'.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I know him."</p>

<p>"Well, now, don't you think you could arrange it?
Do, for my sake."</p>

<p>"But I don't know him well enough. I don't see
how I could."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you do. Haven't I seen you talking
together, and he would be only too pleased. I am
sure he would. Betty's such a nice girl. Now, do
try."</p>

<p>Roland promised that he would do his best, though
it was not a job he particularly fancied. Brewster was
the youngest member of the XI. He had been playing
on lower side games all the season without attracting
any attention and had then surprised everyone by
making a century in an important house match. He
was immediately transplanted to the first, and though he
played in only two matches he was considered to have
earned his colours. He was not, however, in any sense
of the word a blood. He was hardly known by men of
Roland's standing in other houses. He was low in form
and not particularly brilliant at football. Roland knew
next to nothing about him. Still it was a fascinating
situation&mdash;a girl like Betty, who must be a good three
years older than Dolly, getting keen on such a kid.
Was she in love, he wondered. He had never met anyone
who had enjoyed the privilege of having a girl in
love with him. For towards the end he had believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
very little that Howard had told him. It was an
intriguing affair. And so he set himself to his task.</p>

<p>The difficulty, of course, was to find the auspicious
moment. He hardly ever saw Brewster except when
there were a lot of other people about, and he didn't want
to ask him across to his study. People would talk;
and, besides, it would not do to spring this business on
him suddenly. He would have to lead up to it carefully.
For a whole week he sought, unsuccessfully, for an opportunity,
and on the Sunday he had to confess to Dolly
that he was no nearer the attainment of her friend's
desires.</p>

<p>"It's not as easy as you seem to think it is. We are
not in the same house, we are not in the same form, and
we don't play footer on the same ground. In fact,
except that we happen to be in the same school&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now! now! now! Haven't I seen you talking to
him alone twice before I even mentioned him to you?
And if you could be alone with him then, when you had
no particular reason to, surely you can manage to be
now, when you have."</p>

<p>"But, my dear Dolly&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There've not got to be any buts. Either you bring
along your friend or it's all over between us."</p>

<p>It was not a very serious threat, and at any other
stage of their relationship Roland, considering the
bother that the affair involved, might have been glad
enough to accept it as an excuse for his dismissal. But
he had determined to bring this thing off. He thought
of Betty, large, black-haired, bright-eyed, highly
coloured, her full lips moistened by the red tongue that
slipped continually between them, and Brewster, fair-haired
and slim and shy. It would be amusing to see
what they would make of one another. He would carry
the business through, and as a reward for this determination
luck, two days later, came his way. He drew
Brewster in the second round of the Open Fives.</p>

<p>On the first wet day they played it off, and as Roland
was a poor performer and Brewster a tolerably efficient
one the game ended in under half-an-hour. They had,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
therefore, the whole afternoon before them, and Roland
suggested that as soon as they had changed they should
have tea together in his study.</p>

<p>For Roland it was an exciting afternoon; he was
playing, for the first time in his life, the part of a diplomat.
He had read a good many novels in which the motive
was introduced, but there it had been a very different
matter. The stage had been set skilfully; each knew
the other's thoughts without being sure of his intention;
there was a rapier duel of thrust and parry. But here
the stage was set for nothing in particular. Brewster
was unaware of dramatic tension; his main idea was
to eat as much as possible.</p>

<p>With infinite care Roland led the conversation to a
discussion of the mentality of women. He enlarged on
a favourite theme of his&mdash;the fact that girls often fell in
love with really ugly men. "I can't understand it,"
he said. "Girls are such delicate, refined creatures.
They want the right coloured curtains in their bedrooms
and the right coloured cushion for their sofas;
they spend hours discussing the right shade of ribbon
for their hair, and then they go and fall in love with a
ridiculous-looking man. Look at Morgan, now. He's
plain and he's bald and he's got an absurd, stubby
moustache, and yet his wife is frightfully pretty, and
she seems really keen on him. I don't understand it."</p>

<p>Brewster agreed that it was curious, and helped
himself to another cake.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Roland, "that a fellow like you
knows a good deal about girls?"</p>

<p>Brewster shook his head. The subject presented few
attractions to him.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I don't really know anything at all
about them. I haven't got a sister."</p>

<p>"But you don't learn about girls from your sister."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not. But if you haven't got a sister you
don't run much chance of seeing anyone else's. We
don't know any decent ones. A few of my friends have
sisters, but they seem pretty fair asses. I keep out of
their way."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's rather funny, you know, because you're
the sort of fellow that girls run after."</p>

<p>As Roland had been discussing for some time the
ugliness of the type of man that appealed most to girls,
this was hardly a compliment. Brewster did not notice
it, however. Indeed, he evinced no great interest in
the conversation. He was enjoying his tea.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't think I am," he said. "At any rate
none of them have run after me, so far."</p>

<p>"That's all you know," said Roland, and his voice
assumed a tone that made Brewster look up quickly.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Well, I know someone who is doing their best to."</p>

<p>Brewster flushed; the hand that was carrying a
cream cake to his mouth paused in mid air.</p>

<p>"A girl! Who?"</p>

<p>"That's asking."</p>

<p>Roland had at last succeeded in arousing Brewster's
curiosity, and he was wise enough to refrain from satisfying
it at once. If he were to tell him that a girl down
town had wanted to go for a walk with him, Brewster
would have laughed and probably thought no more
about it. He would have to fan his interest till
Brewster's imagination had had time to play upon the
idea.</p>

<p>"She's very pretty," Roland said, "and she asked
me who you were. She was awfully keen to meet you,
but I told her that it was no good and that you wouldn't
care for that sort of thing. She was very disappointed."</p>

<p>"Yes, but who is she?"</p>

<p>"I'm not going to tell you that. Why should I give
her away?"</p>

<p>"Oh, but do tell me."</p>

<p>Roland was firm.</p>

<p>"No; I'm jolly well not going to. It's her secret.
You don't want to meet her, do you?"</p>

<p>"No," Brewster grudgingly admitted; "but I'd like
to know."</p>

<p>"I daresay you would, but I'm not going to give
away a confidence. Suppose you told me that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
were keen on a girl and that you'd heard she wouldn't
have anything to do with anyone, you wouldn't like
me to go and tell her who you were, would you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Of course you wouldn't. That's the sort of thing
one keeps to oneself."</p>

<p>"Yes; but as I shall never see her&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Roland adopted in reply the stern tone of admonition,
"Of course not; but if I told you, you'd take jolly
good care that you did see her, and then you'd tell someone
else. You'd point her out and say, 'That girl wanted
me to come out for a walk with her.' You know you
would, and of course the other fellow would promise
not to tell anyone and of course he would. It would
be round the whole place in a week, and think how the
poor girl would feel being laughed at by everyone because
a fellow four years younger than herself wouldn't
have anything to do with her."</p>

<p>"What! Four years older than me."</p>

<p>"About that."</p>

<p>"And she's pretty, you say?"</p>

<p>"Jolly."</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>"You know, Whately," he began, "I'd rather ..."
then broke off. "Oh, look here, do tell me."</p>

<p>Roland shook his head.</p>

<p>"I don't give away secrets."</p>

<p>"But why did you tell me anything about it at all?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; it just cropped up, didn't it? I
thought it might amuse you."</p>

<p>"Well, I think it's rotten of you. I shan't be able
to think of anything else until I know."</p>

<p>Which was, of course, exactly what Roland wanted.
He knew how Brewster's imagination would play with
the idea. Betty would become for him strange, wistful,
passionate. Four years older than himself he would
picture her as the Lilith of old, the eternal temptress.
In herself she was nothing. If he had met her in the
streets two days earlier he would have hardly noticed
her. "A pleasant, country girl," he would have said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
and let her pass out of his thoughts. But now the
imagination that colours all things would make her
irresistible, and when he met her she would be identified
with his dream.</p>

<p>Next morning Brewster ran across to him during
break.</p>

<p>"I say, Whately, do tell me who she is."</p>

<p>"No; I told you I wasn't going to."</p>

<p>"Well, then. Oh, look here! Is it Dorothy Jones?"</p>

<p>Dorothy Jones was the daughter of the owner of a
cycle shop and was much admired in the school.</p>

<p>"Would you like it to be?" Roland asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know. Perhaps. But is it, though?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps."</p>

<p>"It is Dorothy Jones, isn't it? It is her?"</p>

<p>"If you know, why do you ask me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be a fool! Is it Dorothy Jones?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps."</p>

<p>"Well, if it isn't her, is it Mary Gardiner?"</p>

<p>"It is Mary Gardiner," Roland mocked. "It is she,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you're awful," said Brewster, and walked away.</p>

<p>But that evening he came over to the School house
studies and, just before Hall, a small boy ran across to
the reading-room to tell Roland that Brewster was
in the cloisters and would like to speak to him.</p>

<p>"Well," said Roland, "and what is it?"</p>

<p>"It's about the girl."</p>

<p>Roland affected a weary impatience.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord, but I thought we'd finished with all that.
I told you that I wasn't going to give her away."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know; but ... ah, well, look here, I must
know who the girl is. No, don't interrupt. Will you
tell me if I promise to come out with her once?"</p>

<p>Roland thought for a moment. He had his man
now, but it would not do to hurry things. He must
play for safety a little longer.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I know that game," he said. "I shall tell
you her name and then you'll wish you hadn't promised
and you'll get frightened, and when the time comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
you will have sprained an ankle in a house match and
won't be able to come for a walk. That won't do at
all."</p>

<p>"But I swear I wouldn't do that," Brewster protested.
"Really, I wouldn't."</p>

<p>"Yes, and I promised that I wasn't going to tell."</p>

<p>"But that's so silly. Suppose now that I was really
keen on her. For all you know, or I, for that matter,
I may have seen her walking about the town and
thought her jolly pretty without knowing who she was."</p>

<p>"And I'm damned certain you haven't. You told
me that you didn't take any interest in girls."</p>

<p>"No, but really, honest, man, I may have seen her.
Only this morning as I was going down to Fort's after
breakfast I saw an absolutely ripping girl, and I believe
it was me she smiled at. It's very likely her."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I dare say, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, come on, do tell me, and I promise you I'll
come and see her; honest, I will."</p>

<p>But at that moment the roll-bell issued its cracked
summons.</p>

<p>"If you don't run like sin you'll be late for roll-call,
and that'll finish everything," Roland said, and Brewster
turned and sprinted across the courts.</p>

<p>Roland walked back to his study in a mood of deep
self-satisfaction. He was carrying an extremely difficult
job to a triumphant close. It did not occur to him that
the rôle he filled was not a particularly noble one and
that an unpleasantly worded label could be discovered for
it. He was living in the days of unreflecting action.
He did, or refrained from doing, the things he wanted
to do, without a minute analysis of motive, but in accordance
with a definite code of rules. He lived his life as
he played cricket. There were rewards and there were
penalties. If you hit across a straight long hop you
ran a chance of being leg before, and if the ball hit your
pad you went straight back to the pavilion. You
played to win, but you played the game, provided that
you played it according to the rules. It did not
matter to Roland what the game was. And the affair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
of Betty and Brewster was a game that he was winning
fairly and squarely.</p>

<p>Next morning he achieved victory. He met
Brewster during break and presented his ultimatum.</p>

<p>"I won't tell you her name," he said. "I promised
not to. It wouldn't be the game. But I tell you what
I will do, though. If you'll promise to come out for a
walk with me on Sunday I'll arrange for her to meet
us somewhere, and then you can see what you think of
each other. Now, what do you say to that?"</p>

<p>Brewster's curiosity was so roused that he accepted
eagerly, and next Sunday they set out together towards
Cold Harbour.</p>

<p>About a mile and a half from the school a sunken
lane ran down the side of a steep hill towards the
railway. The lane could be approached from two
sides, and from the shelter of a thick hedge it was
possible to observe the whole country-side without
being seen. It was here that they had arranged their
meeting.</p>

<p>They found the two girls waiting when they arrived.
Betty looked very smart in a dark blue coat and skirt
and a small hat that fitted tightly over her head. She
smiled at Roland, and the sight, after months, of her
fresh-coloured face, with its bright eyes and wide, moist
mouth, sent a sudden thrill through him&mdash;half fear,
half excitement.</p>

<p>"So you've managed to arrange it," said Dolly.
"How clever of you."</p>

<p>"Very nice of him to come," said Betty, her eyes
fixed on Brewster, who stood awkwardly, his hands in
his pockets, kicking one heel against the other.</p>

<p>For a few minutes they talked together, stupid,
inconsequent badinage, punctuated by giggles, till
Betty, as usual, reminded them that they would only
have an hour together.</p>

<p>"About time we paired off, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so," said Roland. "Come along,
Dolly," and they began to walk down the lane. At
the corner they turned and saw the other two standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
together&mdash;Betty, taller, confident and all-powerful;
Brewster, looking up at her, scared and timid, his
hands clasped behind him.</p>

<p>"He looks a bit shy, doesn't he?" said Dolly.</p>

<p>Roland laughed.</p>

<p>"He won't be for long, I expect."</p>

<p>"Rather not. He'll soon get used to her. Betty
doesn't let her boys stop shy with her for long. She
makes them do as she wants them."</p>

<p>And when they returned an hour later they saw the
two sitting side by side chatting happily. But as soon
as they reached them Brewster became silent and shy,
and looked neither of them in the face.</p>

<p>"Had a good time?" asked Dolly.</p>

<p>"Ask him," she answered.</p>

<p>And they laughed, all except Brewster, and made
arrangements to meet again, only a little earlier the
next week.</p>

<p>"Well," said Roland, as soon as they were out of
earshot, "and how did you enjoy yourself?"</p>

<p>Brewster admitted that it had been pretty good.</p>

<p>"Only pretty good?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know," he said, "it was all right.
Yes, it was ripping, really; but it was so different from
what I had expected."</p>

<p>"How do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, you know. I felt so awkward; she
started everything. I didn't have any say in it at all.
I had thought it was up to me to do all that."</p>

<p>"Betty's not that sort."</p>

<p>"No, but it's a funny business."</p>

<p>"You are coming out next week, though?"</p>

<p>"Rather!"</p>

<p>And next week Dolly, as soon as she was alone with
Roland, began to ask him questions about Brewster:
"What did he say to you? What did he think of her?
Was she nice to him? You must tell me all about it."</p>

<p>"Oh, I think he enjoyed himself all right. She
startled him a bit."</p>

<p>"Did she? What did he say? Do tell me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>She asked him question after question, and he had to
repeat to her every word he could remember of Brewster's
conversation. Did he still feel shy? Did he think
Betty beautiful? Was he at all in love with her? And
then Roland began to ask what Betty had thought of
Brewster. Had she preferred him to Howard? She
wasn't disappointed in him? Did she like him better
than the other boys? They talked eagerly.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be fun to go back and have a look at
them?" said Dolly. "I'd give anything to see them
together."</p>

<p>Their eyes met, and suddenly, with a fervour they
had never reached before, they kissed.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a></h3>


<p class="subtitle">APRIL'S LOOKING-GLASS</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">For</span> April the term which brought Roland so
much excitement was slow in passing. In
spite of the disastrous evening at the ball,
Roland's return to school left a void in her life.
When she woke in the morning and stretched herself in
bed before getting up she would ask herself what good
thing she could expect that day to bring her. When
she felt happy she would demand the reason of herself.
"Over what are you happy?" she would ask herself.
"In five minutes' time you will get up. You will put
on your dressing-gown and hurry down the corridor to
the bathroom. You will dress hurriedly, but come
down all the same a little late for breakfast. You will
find that your father has eaten, as is his wont, more
than his share of toast, which will mean that you, being
the last down, will have to go without it. You will rush
down to school saying over to yourself the dates of
your history lesson. You will hang your hat and coat
on the fourth row of pegs and on the seventh peg from
the right. From nine o'clock to ten you will be heard
your history lesson. From ten o'clock till eleven you
will take down notes on chemistry. From eleven to a
quarter past there will be an interval, during which you
will try to find a friend to help you with the Latin translation,
of which you prepared only the first thirty lines
last night. From a quarter-past eleven till a quarter-past
twelve you will be heard that lesson. At a quarter-past
twelve you will attend a lecture on English literature,
which will last till one o'clock. You will then
have lunch, and as to-day is Tuesday you know that
your lunch will consist of boiled mutton and caper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
sauce, followed by apple dumpling. In the afternoon
you will have gymnastics and a music lesson, after
which there will be an hour of Mademoiselle's French
conversation class. You will then come home. You
will hurry your tea in the hope of being able to finish
your preparation before your father comes back from
the office at twenty minutes to seven, because when
once he is back your mother will begin to talk, and when
she begins to talk work becomes impossible. You will
then dine with your parents at half-past seven. You
will sit perfectly quiet at the table and not say a
word, while your mother talks and talks and father
listens and occasionally says, 'Yes, mother,' or 'No,
mother.' After dinner you will read a book in the
drawing-room till your mother reminds you that it is
nine o'clock and time that you were in bed. You have,
in fact, before you a day similar in every detail to yesterday,
and similar in every detail to to-morrow. If you
think anything different is going to happen to you then
you are a little fool." And April would have to confess
that this self-catechism was true. "Nothing happens,"
she would say. "One day is like another, and I am a
little fool to wake up in the morning excited about
nothing at all."</p>

<p>But all the same she was excited and she did feel, in
spite of reason, that something was bound to happen
soon. "Things cannot go on like this for ever," she
told herself. And, looking into the future, she came
gradually to look upon the day of Roland's return from
school as the event which would alter, in a way she
could not discern, the whole tenor of her life. It was
not in these words that the idea was presented to her.
"It may be different during the holidays when Roland
is here." That was her first thought, from which the
words "when Roland is here" detached themselves,
starting another train of thought, that "Life when
Roland is here is always different"; and she began
to look forward to the holidays, counting the days till
his return. "Things will be different then."</p>

<p>It was not love, it was not friendship; it was simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the belief that Roland's presence would be a key to that
world other than this, of which shadowy intimations
haunted her continually. Roland became the focus
for her disquiet, her longing, her vague appreciation of
the eternal essence made manifest for her in the passing
phenomena of life.</p>

<p>"When Roland comes back ..." And though she
marked on the calendar that hung in her bedroom
April 2, the last day of her own term, with a big red
cross, it was April 5 that she regarded as the real beginning
of her holidays. And when she came down to
breakfast and her father said to her, "Only seven more
days now, April," she would answer gaily, "Yes, only
a week. Isn't it lovely?" But to herself she would
add, "Ten days, only ten days more!"</p>

<p>And so she missed altogether the usual last day
excitement. She did not wake on that first morning
happy with the delicious thought that she could lie in
bed for an extra ten minutes if she liked. She had not
yet begun her holidays.</p>

<p>But two days later she was in a fever of expectation.
In twenty-four hours' time Roland would be home.
How slowly the day passed. In the evening she said
she was tired and went to bed before dinner, so that the
next day might come quickly for her. But when she
got to bed she found that she could not sleep, and
though she repeated the word "abracadabra" many
hundred times and counted innumerable sheep passing
through innumerable gates, she lay awake till after midnight,
hearing hour after hour strike. And when at
last sleep came to her it was light and fitful and she
woke often.</p>

<p>Next day she did not know what to do with herself.
She tried to read and could not. She tried to sew and
could not. She ran up and down stairs on trifling
errands in order to pass the time. In vain she tried
to calm herself. "What are you getting so excited
about? What do you think is going to happen?
What can happen? The most that can happen is that
he will come round with his father in the evening, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
you know well enough by now what that will mean.
Your mother will talk and his father will say, 'Yes,
Mrs Curtis,' and 'Really, Mrs Curtis,' and you and
Roland will hardly exchange a word with one another.
You are absurdly excited over nothing."</p>

<p>But logic was of no avail, and all the afternoon she
fidgeted with impatience. By tea-time she was in a
state of repressed hysteria. She sat in the window-seat
looking down the road in the direction from which he
would have to come. "I wonder if he will come without
his father. It would be so dear of him if he would,
but I don't suppose he will. No, of course he won't.
It's silly of me to think of it. He'll have to wait for his
father; he always does. That means he won't be here
at the earliest till after six. And it's only ten minutes
to five now."</p>

<p>And to make things worse, seldom had she found her
mother more annoying.</p>

<p>"Now, why don't you go for a walk, April, dear?" she
said. "It's such a lovely evening and you've been
indoors nearly all day. It isn't good, and I was saying
to your father only the other day, 'Father, dear, I'm
sure April isn't up to the mark. She looks so pale
nowadays.'"</p>

<p>"I'm all right, mother."</p>

<p>"No, but are you, dear? You're looking really
pale. I'm sure I ought to ask Dr Dunkin to come
and see you."</p>

<p>"But I'm all right&mdash;really, I'm all right, mother. I
know when anything is wrong with me."</p>

<p>"But you don't, April, dear. That's just the point.
Don't you remember that time when you insisted on
going to the tennis party and assured us that you were
quite well, and when you came back we found you had
a temperature of 101° and that you were sickening for
measles? I was saying to Dr Dunkin only this morning:
'Dr Dunkin, I'm really not satisfied about our little
April. I think I shall have to ask you to give her a
tonic'; and he said to me: 'Yes, that's right, Mrs Curtis;
you bring me along to her and I'll set her straight.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>April put her hands up to her head and tried not to
listen, but her mother's voice flowed on:</p>

<p>"And now, dear, do go out for a walk&mdash;just a little
one."</p>

<p>"But, mother, dear, I don't want to, really, and I'm
feeling so tired."</p>

<p>"There, what did I say? You're feeling tired and
you've done nothing all day. There must be something
wrong with you. I shall certainly ask Dr Dunkin to
come and see you to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes, yes, mother. I'll do anything you
like to-morrow. If you'll only leave me alone to-night."</p>

<p>But Mrs Curtis went on talking, and April grew more
and more exasperated, and the minutes went past
and Roland did not come. Six struck and half-past
six, and a few minutes later she heard her father's
latch-key in the door. And then the whole question of
her health was dragged out again.</p>

<p>"I was saying to you only yesterday, father, that
our little April wasn't as well as she ought to be. She
has overworked, I think. Last night she went to bed
early and to-day she looks quite pale, and she says
that she feels tired although she hasn't really done
anything. I must send for Dr Dunkin to-morrow."</p>

<p>It seemed to April that the voice would never stop.
It beat and beat upon her brain, like the ticking of the
watch that reminded her of the flying moments.
"He won't come now," she said; "he won't come
now." Seven o'clock had struck, the lamps were lit,
evening had descended upon the street. He had never
come as late as this before. But she still sat at the
window, gazing down the street towards the figures,
that became distinct for a moment in the lamplight.
"He will not come now," she said, and suddenly she
felt limp, tired, incapable of resistance. She put her
head upon her knees and began to sob.</p>

<p>In a moment her mother's arms were round her.
"But, darling, what is it, April, dear?"</p>

<p>She could not speak. She shook her head, tried
desperately to make a sign that she was all right, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
she would rather be left alone; but it was no use. She
felt too bitterly the need for human sympathy. She
turned, flung her arms about her mother's neck, and
began to sob and sob.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, mother," she cried. "I'm so miserable.
I don't know what to do. I don't know what
to do."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Next morning Dr Dunkin felt her pulse, prescribed a
tonic and told her not to stay too much indoors.</p>

<p>"Now, you'll be all right, dear," her mother said.
"Dr Dunkin's medicines are splendid."</p>

<p>April smiled quietly. "Yes, I expect that was what
was wanted. I think I worked a little too hard last
term."</p>

<p>"I'm sure you did, my dear. I shall write to Mrs
Clarke about it. I can't have my little girl getting
run down."</p>

<p>And that afternoon April met Roland in the High
Street. It was the first time that she had seen him
alone since the evening of the dance, and she found
him awkward and embarrassed. They said a few
things of no importance&mdash;about the holidays, the
weather and their acquaintances. Then April said
that she must be going home, and Roland made no
effort to detain her&mdash;did not even make any suggestion
about coming round to see her.</p>

<p>"So that is what you have been looking forward to
for over a month," she said to herself, as he passed out
of sight behind an angle of the road. "This is the date
you wanted to mark upon your calendar with a red
cross. Little fool. What did you think you were
doing? And what has it turned out to be in the end?
Five minutes' discussion of indifferent things. A fine
event to make such a fuss about; and what else did
you expect?"</p>

<p>She was not bitter. It was one of those mild days
that in early spring surprise us with a promise of
summer, on which the heart is stirred with the crowded
glory of life and the sense of widening horizons.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
The long stretch of roofs and chimney stacks became
beautiful in the subdued sunlight. It was an hour
that in the strong might have quickened the hunger
for adventure, but that to April brought a mood of
chastened, quiet resignation. She appreciated, as she
had not done before, the tether by which her scope was
measured. For the last month she had made Roland's
return a focus for the ambitions and desires and yearnings
towards an intenser way of living, for which of
herself she had been unable to find expression. This, in
a confused manner, she understood. "I can do nothing
by myself. I have to live in other people. And what
I am now I shall be always. All my life I shall be
dependent on someone else, or on some interest that is
outside myself. And whether I am happy or unhappy
depends upon some other person. That is my nature,
and I cannot go beyond my nature." When she
reached home she sat for a long time in the window-seat,
her hands folded in her lap. "This will be my
whole life," she said. "I am not of those who may
go out in search of happiness." And she thought that
if romance did not come to her, she would remain all
her life sitting at a window. "Of myself I can do
nothing."</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a></h3>

<p class="subtitle">A SORRY BUSINESS</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">April</span> did not see very much of Roland during
the holidays, and was not, on the whole, sorry.
Now that the hysterical excitement over his
return had passed, she judged it better to let their
friendship lapse. She did not want any repetition of that
disastrous evening, and thought that it would be easier
to resume their friendship on its old basis after the long
interval of the summer term. Roland was still a little
piqued by what he considered her absurd behaviour, and
had resolved to let the first step come from her.</p>

<p>This estrangement was a disappointment to his
people.</p>

<p>"Have you noticed, my dear, that Roland's hardly
been round to the Curtises' at all these holidays?" Mr
Whately said to his wife one evening. "I hope there
has not been a row or anything. I rather wish you'd
try and find out."</p>

<p>And so next day Mrs Whately made a guarded
remark to her son about April's appearance: "What
a big girl she's getting. And she's prettier every day.
If you're not careful you'll have all the boys in the
place running after her and cutting you out."</p>

<p>Roland answered in an off-hand manner, "They can
for all I care, mother."</p>

<p>"Oh, but, Roland, you shouldn't say that; I thought
you were getting on so well together last holidays. We
were even saying&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Roland never allowed himself to be forced into
a confidence.</p>

<p>"Oh, please, mother, don't. There was nothing in
it; really, there wasn't."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"You haven't had a row, have you, Roland?"</p>

<p>"Of course not, mother. What should we have a
row about?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, dear. I only thought&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, you needn't worry about us, mother; we're
all right."</p>

<p>Roland was by no means pleased at what seemed to
him a distinct case of interference. It arrived, too, at a
most inopportune moment, for he had been just then
wondering whether he ought not to forget about his
high-minded resolves and try to make it up with
April. His mother's inquiries, however, decided him.
He was not going to have others arranging that sort of
thing for him. "And for all I know," he said to himself,
"Mrs Curtis may be at the back of this. I shan't
go round there again these holidays." And this was
the more unfortunate, because if the intimacy between
Roland and April had been resumed, it is more than
likely that Roland, at the beginning of the summer term,
would have decided to give up Dolly altogether. Both
he and Brewster were a little tired of it; the first
interest had passed, and they had actually discussed the
wisdom of dropping the whole business.</p>

<p>"After all," said Brewster, "it can't go on for ever.
It'll have to stop some time, and next term we shall
both be fairly high in the school, house prefects and
all that, and we shall have to be pretty careful what
we do."</p>

<p>Roland was inclined to agree with him, but his
curiosity was still awake.</p>

<p>"It's not so easy to break a thing like this. Let's wait
till the end of the term. The summer holidays are a
long time, and by the time we come back they'll very
likely have picked up someone else."</p>

<p>"All right," said Brewster, "I don't mind. And it
does add an interest to things."</p>

<p>And so the affair went on smoothly and comfortably,
a pleasant interlude among the many good gifts of a
summer term&mdash;cricket and swimming and the long,
lazy evenings. Nothing, indeed, occurred to ruffle the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
complete happiness of Roland's life, till one Monday
morning during break Brewster came running across
to the School house studies with the disastrous news
that his house master had found out all about it.
It had happened thus:</p>

<p>On the previous Saturday Roland had sent up a note
in break altering the time of an appointment. It was
the morning of a school match and Brewster received
the note on his way down to the field. He was a little
late, and as soon as he had read the note he shoved it
into his pocket and thought no more about it. During
the afternoon he slipped, trying to bring off a one-handed
catch in the slips, and tore the knee of his
trousers. The game ended late and he had only just
time to change and take his trousers round to the
matron to be mended before lock-up. In the right-hand
pocket the matron discovered Roland's note,
and, judging its contents singular, placed it before Mr
Carus Evans.</p>

<p>As Roland walked back with Brewster from the tuck-shop
a small boy ran up to tell him that Mr Carus Evans
would like to see him directly after lunch.</p>

<p>Roland was quite calm as he walked up the hill three
hours later. One is only frightened when one is uncertain
of one's fate. When a big row is on, in which
one may possibly be implicated, one endures agonies,
wondering whether or not one will be found out. But
when it is settled, when one is found out, what is there
to do? One must let things take their course; nothing
can alter it. There is no need for fret or fever. Roland
was able to consider his position with detached interest.</p>

<p>He had been a fool to send that note. Notes always
got lost or dropped and the wrong people picked them
up. How many fellows had not got themselves bunked
that way, notes and confirmation? They were the
two great menaces, the two hidden rocks. Probably
confirmation was the more dangerous. On the whole,
more fellows had got the sack through confirmation,
but notes were not much better. What an ass he had
been. He would never send a note again, never; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
swore it to himself, and then reflected a little dismally
that he might very likely never have the opportunity.</p>

<p>Still, that was rather a gloomy view to take. And he
stood more chance with Carus Evans than he would
have done with any other master. Carus Evans had
always hated him, and because he hated him would be
desperately anxious to treat him fairly. As a result
he would be sure to underpunish him. It is always
safer to have a big row with a master who dislikes you
than with one who is your friend. And from this
reflection Roland drew what comfort he might.</p>

<p>Mr Carus Evans sat writing at his desk when Roland
came in. He looked up and then went on with his
letter. It was an attempt to make Roland feel uncomfortable
and to place him at the start at a disadvantage.
It was a characteristic action, for Carus
Evans was a weak man. His house was probably the
slackest in the school. It had no one in the XV.,
Brewster was its sole representative in the XI. and it
did not possess one school prefect. This should not
have been, for Carus Evans was a bachelor and all his
energies were available. He had no second interest to
attract him, but he was weak when he should have been
strong; he chose the wrong prefects and placed too
much confidence in them. He was not a natural leader.</p>

<p>For a good two minutes he went on writing, then put
down his pen.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, yes, Whately. Sit down, will you? Now
then, I've been talking to one of the boys in my house
and it seems that you and he have been going out
together and meeting some girls in the town. Is that
so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And the suggestion came from you, I gather?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"This is a very serious thing, Whately. I suppose
you realise that?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so, sir."</p>

<p>"Of course it is, and especially so for a boy in
your position. Now, I don't know what attitude the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
headmaster will adopt, but of this I am quite certain. A
great deal will depend on whether you tell me the truth.
I shall know if you tell me a lie. You've got to tell me
the whole story. Now, how did this thing start?"</p>

<p>"On the first night of the Christmas term, sir."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"I met them at a dance in the pageant grounds."</p>

<p>"The pageant grounds are out of bounds. You
ought to know that."</p>

<p>"It was the first night, sir."</p>

<p>"Don't quibble with me. They're out of bounds.
Well, what happened next?"</p>

<p>"I danced with her, sir."</p>

<p>"Were you alone?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Who was with you?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell you, sir."</p>

<p>"If you don't tell me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's left now, sir. It wouldn't be fair."</p>

<p>They looked each other in the face and in that
moment Carus Evans realised that, in spite of their
positions, Roland was the stronger.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, never mind that; we can leave it till later
on. And I suppose you made an appointment?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"You asked me if I made an appointment, sir. I
answered I didn't."</p>

<p>Roland was not going to give him the least assistance.
Indeed, in the joy of being able to play once again the
old game of baiting masters, that had delighted him so
much when he had been in the middle school and that
he had to abandon so reluctantly when he attained the
dignity of the Fifths and Sixths, he had almost forgotten
that he was in a singularly difficult situation.
He would make "old Carus" ask him a question for
every answer that he gave. And he saw that for the
moment Carus had lost his length.</p>

<p>"Well, then, let me see. Yes, well&mdash;er&mdash;well,
where did you meet her next?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>"In a lane beyond Cold Harbour, sir."</p>

<p>"Did you go there alone?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"You were with this other fellow?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And what did you do?"</p>

<p>"Do, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes, do. Didn't you hear me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, but, Do? I don't quite understand you.
What exactly do you mean by the word 'do'?"</p>

<p>"You know perfectly well what I mean, Whately.
You flirted, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I suppose that's what I did do. I
flirted."</p>

<p>"I mean you held her hand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And you kissed her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Disgusting! Simply disgusting! Is this place a
heathen brothel or a Christian school?" Carus' face
was red, and he drove his fingers through the hair at
the back of his neck. "You go out on a Sunday afternoon
and kiss a shop-girl. What a hobby for a boy in
the XV. and Sixth!" And he began to stamp backwards
and forwards up and down the room.</p>

<p>This fine indignation did not, however, impress
Roland in the least. Carus appeared to him to be less
disgusted than interested&mdash;pruriently interested&mdash;and
that he was angry with himself rather than with
Roland, because he knew instinctively that he was not
feeling as a master should feel when confronted with
such a scandal. It was a forced emotion that was
inspiring the fierce flow of words.</p>

<p>"Do you know what this sort of thing leads to?"
he was saying. "But, of course, you do. I could
trust you to know anything like that. Your whole life
may be ruined by it."</p>

<p>"But I didn't do anything wrong."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you didn't, not this time, though I've
only your word for it; but you would have, sooner or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
later, under different conditions. There's only one
end to that sort of thing. And even if you were all
right yourself, how did you know that Brewster was
going to be? That's the beastly part of it. That's
what sickens me with you. Your own life is your own
to do what you like with, but you've no right to
contaminate others. You encourage this young fellow
to go about with a girl four years older than himself,
about whom you know nothing. How could you tell
what might be happening to him? He may not have
your self-control. He'd never have started this game
but for you, and now that he's once begun he may be
unable to break himself of it. You may have ruined
his whole life, mayn't you?"</p>

<p>Roland considered the question.</p>

<p>"I suppose so, but I didn't look at it that way."</p>

<p>"Of course, you didn't. But it's the results that
count. That's what you've got to keep in mind;
actions are judged by their results. And now,
what do you imagine is going to happen to you? I
suppose you know that if I go across and report you to
the headmaster that it'll mean the next train back to
London?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And if I did, you'd have no cause for complaint.
It would be what you'd deserved, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>There was a pause. They looked at each other.
Carus Evans hoped that he had frightened Roland, but
he had not. Roland knew that Carus did not intend
to get him expelled. He would not have talked like
that if he had. He was trying to make Roland feel
that he was conferring a favour on him in allowing him
to stop on.</p>

<p>"There's no reason why I should feel kindly disposed
towards you," Carus said. "We've never got on well
together. You've worked badly in my form. I've
never regarded you as a credit to the school. When
you were a small boy you were rowdy and bumptious,
and now that you have reached a position of authority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
you have become superior and conceited. There's no
reason why I, personally, should wish to see you remain
a member of the school. As regards my own house, I
cannot yet judge what harm you may have done me.
You've started the poison here. Brewster will have
told his friends. One bad apple will corrupt a cask.
I don't know what trouble you may have laid up
for me."</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"But all the same, I know what it means to expel
a boy. He's a marked man for life. I'm going to give
you another chance."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>"But you've got to make this thing good first.
You've got to go to the headmaster yourself and tell
him all about it&mdash;now, at once. Do you see?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>It was going to be an awkward business, and Roland
made no attempt to conceal it from himself. It was
just on the half-hour as he walked across the courts.
Afternoon school was beginning. Groups had collected
round the classrooms, waiting for the master to let them
in. Johnson waved to him from a study window and
told him to hurry up and help them with the con.</p>

<p>"Don't wait for me," Roland called back. "I've
got one or two things to do. I shall be a little late."</p>

<p>"Slacker," Johnson laughed.</p>

<p>It was funny to see the machine revolving so
smoothly, with himself, to all outward appearance, a
complacently efficient cog in it. He supposed that a
criminal must feel like this when he watched people
hurry past him in the streets; all of them so intent
upon their own affairs and himself seemingly one with
them, but actually so much apart.</p>

<p>He knocked at the headmaster's door.</p>

<p>"Come in."</p>

<p>The headmaster was surprised to see Roland at such
an hour.</p>

<p>"Yes, Whately?" he said, and then appeared to
remember something, and began to fumble among some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
papers on his desk. "One moment, Whately; I knew
there was something I wanted to speak to you about.
Ah, yes, here it is. Your essay on Milton. Will you
just come over here a minute? I wanted to have a few
words with you about it. Sit down, won't you? Now,
let me see, where is it? Ah, yes, here it is: now you
say, 'Milton was a Puritan in spite of himself. Satan is
the hero of the poem.' Now I want to be quite certain
what you mean by that. I'm not going to say that you
are wrong. But I want you to be quite certain in your
own mind as to what you mean yourself."</p>

<p>And Roland began to explain how Milton had let
himself be carried away by his theme, that his nature
was so impregnated by the sense of defeat that defeat
seemed to him a nobler thing than victory. Satan had
become the focus for his emotions on the overthrow of
the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I see that, but surely, Whately, the
Commonwealth was the Puritan party. If Milton was
so distressed by the return of the Royalists, how do you
square this view with your statement, 'Milton was a
Puritan in spite of himself'? Surely if his puritanism
was only imposed, he would have welcomed the return
of the drama and a more highly coloured life."</p>

<p>Roland made a gallant effort to explain, but all the
time he kept saying to himself, "I came here for a
confessional, and yet here I am sitting down in the
Chief's best arm-chair, enjoying a friendly chat. I must
stop it somehow." But it was excessively difficult.
He began to lose the thread of his argument and contradicted
himself; and the Chief was so patient, listening
to him so attentively, waiting till he had finished.</p>

<p>"But, my dear Whately," the Chief said, "you've
just said that <cite>Comus</cite> is a proof of his love of colour
and display, and yet you say in the same breath...."</p>

<p>Would it never cease? And how on earth was he
at the end going to introduce the subject of his miserable
amours? He had never anticipated anything like this.
But at last it was finished.</p>

<p>"You see what you've done, Whately? You've<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
picked up a phrase somewhere or other about the
paganism of Milton and the nobility of Satan and you
have not taken the trouble to think it out. You've
just accepted it. I don't say that your statement
could not be justified. But it's you who should be able
to justify it, not I. You should never make any
statement in an essay that you can't substantiate with
facts. It's a good essay, though, quite good." And
he returned to his papers. He had forgotten altogether
that Roland had come unasked to see him.</p>

<p>It was one of the worst moments of Roland's life.
He stood silent in the middle of the room while the Chief
continued his letter, thinking the interview was at an
end.</p>

<p>"Sir," he said at last.</p>

<p>The headmaster looked up quickly and said a little
impatiently, for he was a busy man and resented
interruption, "Well, Whately? Yes; what is it?"</p>

<p>"I came to see you, sir."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, of course you did. I forgot. Well, what
is it?"</p>

<p>"Sir, I've come to tell you that Mr Carus Evans
told me to come and report myself to you and say that&mdash;well,
sir&mdash;that I've been going out for walks with a girl
in the town."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, a girl in the town, and that I'd asked a boy
in his house to come with me, sir."</p>

<p>The Chief rose from his chair and walked across to the
mantelpiece. There was a long pause.</p>

<p>"But I don't quite understand, Whately. You've
been going out with some girl in the town?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And you've encouraged some boy in Mr Carus Evans'
house to accompany you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And he, I suppose, has been going for walks with a
girl as well?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>There was another long pause, during which Roland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
realised that he had chosen the worst possible moment
for his confession. Whatever decision the Chief might
arrive at would be influenced, not only by his inevitable
disappointment at the failure of a boy in whom
he had trusted, but by its violent contrast with the
friendly discussion over the essay and the natural
annoyance of a busy man who has been interrupted in
an important piece of work to discuss an unpleasant
situation that has arisen unexpectedly. When the
Chief at last began to speak there was an impatience in
his voice that would have been absent if Roland had
tackled him after dinner.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he said. "I am tempted sometimes
to give up faith in you fellows altogether. I never
know where I am with any of you. I feel as though I
were sitting upon a volcano. Everything seems quiet
and satisfactory and then suddenly the volcano breaks
out and I find that the boys in whom I have placed, or
am thinking of placing, responsibility have deceived me.
Do you realise the hypocrisy of your behaviour during
the last year? You have been meeting Mr Carus Evans
and myself on friendly, straightforward terms, with an
open look on your face, and all the time, behind our
backs, you've been philandering with girls in the town.
I haven't asked you for any details and I am not going
to; that doesn't enter into the question at all. You've
been false and doublefaced. You've been acting a lie
for a year. It's the sort of thing that makes me sick of
the whole lot of you. You can go."</p>

<p>Roland walked back to the studies, perplexed and
miserable. The word "deceit" had cut hard into him.
He loathed crookedness and he had always considered
himself dead straight. It was a boast of his that he had
never told a lie, at least not to a boy; masters were
different. Of course they were, and it was absurd to
pretend they weren't. Everyone did things that they
wouldn't care to tell the Chief. There was a barrier
between. The relationship was not open like friendship.
He saw the Chief's point of view, but he
did not consider it a sound one. He disliked these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
fine gradations of conduct, this talk of acting a lie:
things were either black or white. He remembered
how the Chief had once come round the upper dormitories
and had endeavoured to persuade him that it
was acting a lie to get into bed without cleaning his
teeth. He had never understood why. An unclean
act, perhaps, but acting a lie! oh, no, it wouldn't do.
It was an unfair method of tackling the problem. It
was hitting a man in the back, this appeal to a better
nature. Life should be played like cricket, according
to rules. You could either play for safety and score
slowly, or you could run risks and hit across straight half-volleys.
If one missed it one was out and that was the
end of it. One didn't talk about acting a lie to the
bowler because one played at the ball as though it
were outside the leg stump. Why couldn't the Chief
play the game like an umpire? Roland knew that he
had done a thing which, in the eyes of authority, was
wrong. He admitted that. He had known it was
wrong all the time. He had been found out; he
was prepared for punishment. That was the process
of life. One took risks and paid the penalty. The
issue was to Roland childishly simple, and he could not
see why all these good people should complicate it so
unnecessarily with their talk of hypocrisy and deceit.</p>

<p>That evening the headmaster wrote to Roland's
father:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear</span> Mr <span class="smcap">Whately</span>,&mdash;I write to inform you of a
matter that will cause you, I fear, a good deal of pain.
I have discovered that for the last year Roland has been
in the habit of going out for walks on Sunday afternoons
with a young girl in the town, and that he has encouraged
another and younger boy to accompany him.
These walks resulted, I am sure, in nothing beyond a
little harmless flirtation, and I do not regard the actual
issue as important. I do consider, however, and I
think that in this you will agree with me, that Roland's
conduct in the matter is most reprehensible. It has
involved a calculated and prolonged deception of you,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>his parent, and of us, his schoolmasters, and he has
proved himself, I fear, unworthy of the responsibility
of prefectship that I had hoped to place in him next
term. If he were a younger boy the obvious course
would be a sound thrashing. But Roland is too old for
that. Perhaps he is too old to be at school at all. The
leaving age of nineteen is arbitrary. Boys develop at
such different ages; and though I should not myself
have thought so before this affair arose, it may very well
be that Roland has already passed beyond the age
at which it is wise and, indeed, safe to keep him any
longer at a school. For all we know, this trouble may
prove to have been a blessing in disguise, and will have
protected him from more serious difficulties. At any
rate, I do not feel that I should be doing my duty by
you or by the other parents who place the welfare of
their boys in my hands if I were to keep Roland here
after the summer. There is, of course, in this not the
least suggestion of expulsion. Roland will leave at the
end of the term with many of his contemporaries in
the ordinary course of events. And he will become,
if he wishes, as I hope he will wish, a member of the
old Fernhurstian Society. Perhaps you may yourself
decide to come down and have a talk with Roland. If
so, perhaps we might discuss his future together. I
do not myself see why this should prejudice in any
way his going up to the University in a year's time. Of
course he could not go up now as he has not yet passed
responsions.</p>

<p>I very much hope that you will come down and that
we shall be able to discuss the whole matter from every
point of view. Sincerely yours,</p>

<p>This letter arrived at Hammerton by the evening
post. Mr Whately had that morning received a letter
from Roland, written before the row, with an account
of a house game in which he had made 59 runs and
taken 3 wickets. Mr Whately was most excited.</p>

<p>"He's really doing remarkably well," he said, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
dinner. "He says that he's pretty certain for his
second XI. colours, and I can't think why they don't
give him a trial for the first. I know that Fernhurst
have a pretty strong side this year, but they ought to
try all the men they've got."</p>

<p>"He ought to get in next year at any rate," said his
wife.</p>

<p>"Next year! Of course there should be no doubt
about that at all. But I should like to see him get in
this. It will make a big difference to his last term if
he knows he's safe for his place. It's always a little
worrying having to play for one's colours, and I should
like him to have a really good last term. He's deserved
it; he's worked hard; he's been a real success at
Fernhurst."</p>

<p>His soliloquy was at this point interrupted by the
double knock of the postman. Mr Whately jumped up
at once.</p>

<p>"The Fernhurst postmark, my dear," he said. "I
wonder what this can be about. The headmaster's
writing!"</p>

<p>He tore open the envelope eagerly and began to
read.</p>

<p>"Well, dear?" said his wife.</p>

<p>He said nothing, but handed the letter across to her.
She read it through and then sat forward in her chair,
her hands lying on her knees.</p>

<p>"Poor darling," she said. "So that's why he saw
so little of April last holidays."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose that's the reason."</p>

<p>"Do you think he was in love with her?"</p>

<p>"With April?"</p>

<p>"No, of course not, dear. With this girl at Fernhurst?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. How could I tell?"</p>

<p>And again they sat in silence. It was such a long
while since they had been called upon to face a serious
situation. For many years now they had lived upon
the agreeable surface of an ordered life. They were
unprepared for this disquieting intrusion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>"And what's going to happen now?" she said at
last. "I suppose you'll have to go down and see him."</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so. Yes, certainly. I ought to go
down to-morrow."</p>

<p>"And what will you say to him?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. What is it the headmaster says?"</p>

<p>She handed him the letter and he fumbled with it.
"Here it is. 'I do not see myself why this should prejudice
in any way his going up to the University.'
That's what the headmaster says. But I don't really
see how we could manage it. After all, what would
happen? He would have to go to a crammer's and
everyone would ask questions. We have always said
how good the Fernhurst education is, and now they'll
begin to wonder why we've changed our minds. If we
take Roland away and send him to a crammer's they
would be sure to think something was up. You know
what people are. It would never do."</p>

<p>"No, I suppose not. But it seems rather hard on
Roland if he's got to give up Oxford."</p>

<p>"Well, it will be his own fault, won't it?"</p>

<p>"We haven't heard the whole story yet."</p>

<p>"I know; but what's the good of discussing it. He
knew he was doing something he ought not to be doing.
He can't expect not to have to pay for it."</p>

<p>And there was another pause.</p>

<p>"He was doing so well, too," she said.</p>

<p>"He would have been a prefect after the summer.
He would have been captain of his house. We should
have been so proud of him."</p>

<p>"And it's all over now."</p>

<p>They did not discuss the actual trouble. He knew
that on the next day he would have to go over the whole
thing with Roland, and he wanted to be able to think it
out in quiet. They were practical people, who had spent
the last fifteen years discussing the practical affairs of
ways and means. They had come nearest to each other
when they had sat before their account-books in the
evening, balancing one column with another, and at the
end of it looking each other in the face, agreeing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
they would have to "cut down this expense," and that
they could "save a little there." The love of the senses
had died out quickly between them, but its place had
been taken by a deep affection, by the steady accumulation
of small incidents of loyalty and unselfishness, of
difficulties faced and fought together. They had never
ventured upon first principles. They had fixed their
attention upon the immediate necessities of the moment.</p>

<p>And now, although Roland's moral welfare was a
deep responsibility to them, they spoke only of his
career and of how they must shape it to fit the new
requirements. Mr Whately thought that he might be
able to find a post for him in the bank. But his wife
was very much against it.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, dear, that would be terrible. Roland could
never stand it; he's such an open-air person. I can't
bear to think of him cooped up at a desk all his
days."</p>

<p>"That's what my life's been."</p>

<p>"I know; but, Roland. Surely we can find something
better for him than that."</p>

<p>"I'll try. I don't know. Things like the Civil
Service are impossible for him now, and the Army's no
use, and I've got no influence in the City."</p>

<p>"But you must try, really, dear. It's awful to think
of him committed to a bank for the rest of his life just
when he was doing so well."</p>

<p>"All right. I'll do my best."</p>

<p>A few minutes later he said that he was tired and
would go to bed. At the door he paused, walked back
into the room and stood behind his wife. He wanted
to say something to show that he appreciated her
sympathy, that he was glad she was beside him in this
disappointment, this hour of trouble. But he did not
know what to say. He stretched out a hand timidly
and touched her hair. She turned and looked up at
him, and without a word said put her arms slowly about
his neck, drew his hand down to her and kissed him.
For a full minute he was pressed against her. "Dear,"
he murmured, and though he mounted the stairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
sadly, he felt strengthened by that embrace of mutual
disappointment.</p>

<p>He set off very early next morning, for he would have
to go down to the bank and make arrangements for
his absence. He had hoped that Roland would have
written to them, but the post brought only a circular
from a turf accountant.</p>

<p>"Have you decided what you are going to say to
him?" his wife asked.</p>

<p>"Not yet. I shall think it out in the train. I
shall be able to say the right thing when the time
comes."</p>

<p>"You won't be hard to him. I expect he's very
miserable."</p>

<p>It was a bad day for Mr Whately. During the long
train journey through fields and villages, vivid in the
bright June sunlight, he wondered in what spirit he
should receive his son. Roland would be no doubt
waiting for him at the station. What would they say
to each other? How would they begin? He would
have lunch, of course, at the Eversham Hotel, and then,
he supposed, he would have to see the headmaster.
That would be very difficult. He always felt shy in
the headmaster's presence. The headmaster was such
an aristocrat; he was stamped with the hall-mark of
Eton and Balliol, while he himself was the manager of
a bank in London. He was always aware of his social
inferiority in that book-lined study, with the five
austere reproductions of Greek sculpture. The interview
would be very difficult. But the headmaster
would at least do most of the talking; whereas with
Roland.... Mr Whately shifted uneasily in his corner
seat. What on earth was he going to say? Something,
surely, about the moral significance of the act.
Roland must realise that he was guilty of really immoral
conduct, and yet how was he to be made to realise
it? What arguments must be produced? Wherein
lay the harm of calf love? And looking back over
his own life Mr Whately could not see that there was
any particular vice attached to it. It was absurd and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
preposterous, but it was very pleasant. He remembered
how he had once fancied himself in love with his grandmother's
housemaid. He used to get up early in the
morning so that he could sit with her while she laid the
grate, and he had knelt down beside her and joined
his breath with hers in a fierce attempt to kindle the
timid flame. He had never kissed her, but she had
let him hold her hand, and the summer holidays had
passed in delicious reveries. He remembered also
how, a little later, he had fallen desperately in love
with the girl at the tobacconist's, and he could still
recall the breathless excitement of that morning
when he had come into the shop and found it empty.
For a second she had listened at the door leading
to the private part of the house and had then
leant forward over the counter: "Quick," she had
whispered.</p>

<p>Mr Whately smiled at the recollection and then remembered
suddenly for what cause he was travelling
down to Fernhurst. "I must say something to him.
What shall I say?" And for want of any better
argument he began to adapt a speech that he had
heard spoken a few weeks earlier in a melodrama at the
Aldwich. The hero, a soldier, had come home from the
war to find his betrothed in the arms of another, and
she had protested that it was him alone she loved, and
that she was playing with the other; but the returned
warrior had delivered himself of an oration on the
eternal sanctity of love. "Love cannot be divided
like a worm and continue to exist. It is not a game."
There was something in that argument, and Mr Whately
decided to tell Roland that love came only once in a
man's life, and that he must reserve himself for that
one occasion. "If you make love to every girl you
meet, you will spoil yourself for the real love affair. It
will be the removal of a shovelful of gravel from a large
pile. One shovelful appears to make no difference, but
in the end the pile of gravel disappears." That is
what he would say to Roland. And because the idea
seemed suitable, he did not pause to consider whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
or not it was founded upon truth. He lay back in his
corner seat and began to arrange his ideas according to
that line of persuasion.</p>

<p>But all this fine flow of wit and logic was dispelled
when the train drew up at Fernhurst station and Mr
Whately descended from the carriage to find Roland
waiting for him on the platform.</p>

<p>"Hullo! father," he said, and the two of them walked
in silence out of the station, and turned into the Eversham
Rooms.</p>

<p>"I've booked a table at the hotel," said Roland.</p>

<p>"Good."</p>

<p>"I expect you're feeling a bit hungry after your
journey, aren't you, father?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am a bit."</p>

<p>"Not a bad day for travelling, though?"</p>

<p>"No, it was very jolly. The country was beautiful
all the way down. It's such a relief to be able to get
out of London for a bit."</p>

<p>"I expect it must be."</p>

<p>"It's quite a treat to be able to come here"; and so
nervous was he that he failed to appreciate the irony of
his last statement.</p>

<p>By this time they had reached the hotel. Roland
walked with a cheerful confidence into the entrance,
nodded to the porter, hung his straw hat upon the
rack, and suggested a wash.</p>

<p>Mr Whately looked at himself in the glass as he dried
his hands. It was a withered face that looked back at
him; the face of a bank clerk who had risen with some
industry and much privation to a position of authority;
a face that was lined and marked and undistinguished;
the face of a man who had never asserted himself. Mr
Whately turned from his own reflection and looked at
his son, so strong, and fresh and eager; unmarked as
yet by trouble and adversity. Who was he, a scrubby,
middle-aged little man, emptied of energy and faith,
with his life behind him&mdash;who was he to impose his
will on anyone?</p>

<p>"Finished, father?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>He followed his son into the dining-room and picked
up the menu; but he did not know what to choose, and
handed the card across to Roland. Roland ordered the
meal; the waiter rubbed his hands, and father and
son sat opposite each other, oppressed by a situation
that was new to them. Roland waited for his father
to begin. During the last thirty-six hours he had been
interviewed by three different masters, all of whom had,
in their way, tried to impress upon him the enormity
of his offence. He was by now a little tired of the
subject. He wanted to know what punishment had
been fixed for him. He had heard enough of the moral
aspect of the case. "These people treat me as though
I were a fool," he had said to Brewster. "To hear the
way they talked one would imagine that I had never
thought about the damnable business at all. They
seem to expect me to fall down, like St Paul before
Damascus, and exclaim: 'Now, all is clear to me!'
But, damn it all, I knew what I was doing. I'd thought
it all out. I'm not going to do the conversion stunt
just because I've been found out." He expected his
father to go over the old ground&mdash;influence, position,
responsibility. He prepared himself to listen. But
as his father did not begin, and as the soup did not
arrive, Roland felt it was incumbent upon him to say
something.</p>

<p>"A great game that against Yorkshire?" he said.</p>

<p>"What! Which game?"</p>

<p>"Don't you remember, about a fortnight ago, the
Middlesex and Yorkshire match? Middlesex had over
two hundred to get and only three hours to get them in.
They're a fine side this year."</p>

<p>And within two minutes they were discussing cricket
as they had discussed it so often before. At first they
talked to cover their embarrassment, but soon they
had become really interested in the subject.</p>

<p>"And what chance do you think you have of getting
in the XI.? Surely they ought to give you a trial
soon."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know, father; I'm not much class, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
there are several old colours. I ought to get my
seconds all right, and next season...."</p>

<p>He stopped, realising suddenly that he did not as yet
know whether there would be any next season for him,
and quickly changed the conversation, telling his father
of a splendid rag that the Lower Fourth had organised
for the last Saturday of the term.</p>

<p>Sooner or later the all-important question had to be
tackled, but by the time lunch had finished, son and
father had established their old intimacy of quiet
conversation, and they were ready to face and, if need
be, to dismiss the violent intrusion of the trouble. They
walked up and down the hotel grounds, Mr Whately
wondering at what exact point he should dab in his
carefully constructed argument. There was a pause,
into which his voice broke suddenly:</p>

<p>"You know, Roland, about this business...."</p>

<p>"Yes, father."</p>

<p>"Well, I mean, going out with a girl in the town.
Do you think it's...." He paused. After all, he did
not know what to say.</p>

<p>"I know, father. I know." And looking at each
other they realised that it would be impossible for them
to discuss it. Their relationship was at stake. It had
no technique to deal with the situation. And Roland
asked, as his mother had asked, "What's going to
happen, father?"</p>

<p>For answer, Mr Whately put his hand into his pocket,
took out the headmaster's letter and gave it to Roland.
Roland read it through and then handed it back.
"Not a bad fellow, the Chief," he said, and they walked
up and down the path in silence.</p>

<p>"It's a disappointment," said Roland.</p>

<p>"For all of us."</p>

<p>"I suppose so."</p>

<p>And after another pause: "What's going to happen
to me at the end of the term?"</p>

<p>"That's what I've got to decide. I suggested a
bank, but your mother was very much against it."</p>

<p>"Oh, not the bank, father!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I'll do my best for you, but it'll be difficult.
Oxford's out of the question. You can see that, can't
you? I should have to send you to a crammer, and
everyone would talk. It would be sure to leak out.
And we don't want anything like that to happen,
because they would be sure to think it was something
worse than it really was. I'm afraid Oxford's got to
go. Your mother agreed with me about that."</p>

<p>"I'm sure you're right, father."</p>

<p>"But I don't know what else there is, Roland. I
shall have to ask the headmaster."</p>

<p>But the headmaster was not very helpful. He was
kind and sympathetic. He spoke of the moral significance
of the situation and the eventual service that
this trouble might prove to have been. He wished
Roland the very best of luck. He didn't agree with
Mr Whately about the impossibility of Oxford, but he
appreciated Mr Whately's point of view. After all,
Mr Whately knew his own son better than he did.
Was there anything more Mr Whately would wish to
ask him? He would be always very glad to give Mr
Whately any advice or help that lay within him. He
hoped Mr Whately would have a pleasant journey
back to town.</p>

<p>"Dorset's at its best in June," he said, as he escorted
Mr Whately to the door.</p>

<p>There was an hour to put in before the departure of
the London train, and Roland and his father walked
down to the cricket field. They sat on the grass in the
shade of the trees that cluster round the pavilion, and
watched the lazy progress of the various games that
were scattered round the large high-walled ground.
It was a pretty sight&mdash;the green fields, the white flannels,
the mild sunshine of early summer. It was bitter to
Mr Whately that he would never again see Fernhurst.
For that was what Roland's trouble meant to him.
And the reflection saddened his last hour with his son.</p>

<p>When Roland had left him at the station he walked
up and down the platform in the grip of a deep melancholy.
On such an afternoon, five years ago, he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
seen Fernhurst for the first time. He had brought
Roland down to try for a scholarship and they had
stayed for three days together at the Eversham Hotel.
Fernhurst had been full of promise for them then. He
had not been to a public school himself. When he was
a boy the public school system had indeed hardly begun
to impose its autocracy on the lower middle classes,
and he had always felt himself at a disadvantage
because he had been educated at Burstock Grammar
School. He had been desperately anxious for Roland
to make a success of Fernhurst. He had looked forward
to the day when his son would be an important
figure in the school, and when he himself would become
important as Whately's father. How proud he would
feel when he would walk down to the field in the company
of a double first. He would come down to
"commem" and give a luncheon party at the Eversham
Hotel, and the masters would come and speak to him
and congratulate him on his son's performance: "A
wonderful game of his last week against Tonwich." And
during the last eighteen months it had indeed seemed
that these dreams were to be realised. Roland had
his colours at football, he was in the Sixth, a certainty
for his seconds at cricket: after the summer he would
be a prefect and captain of games in the house. And
now it was all over. As far as he was concerned, Fernhurst
was finished. His life would be empty now
without the letter every Monday morning telling of
Roland's place in form, of his scores during the week,
and all the latest news of a vivid communal life. That
was over. And as Mr Whately mounted the train,
closed the door and sat back against the carriage, he
felt as though he were undergoing an operation; a
part of his being was being wrenched from him.</p>

<p>Roland felt none of this despondency. After saying
good-bye to his father he walked gaily up the Eversham
Road. The brown stone of the Abbey tower was
turning to gold in the late sunlight, a cool wind was
blowing, the sky was blue. What did this trouble
matter to him? Had he not strength and faith and time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
in plenty to repair it? He had wearied of school, he
reminded himself. He had felt caged this last year;
he had wanted freedom; he had outgrown the narrow
discipline of the field and classroom. Next term he
would be a man and not a schoolboy. He flung back
his shoulders as though he were ridding them of a
burden.</p>

<p>There was still three-quarters of an hour to put in
before lock-up, and he walked up past the big school
towards the hill. He thought he would like to tell
Brewster what had happened. He found him in his
study, and with him an old boy, Gerald Marston, who
had been playing against the school that afternoon.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" he said. "So here's the criminal. I've
just been hearing all about you. Come along and sit
down."</p>

<p>Roland was flattered at Marston's interest in his
escapade. He had hardly known him at all when he
had been at Fernhurst. Marston had been in another
house, was two years his senior, and, in addition, a
double first. Probably it was the first time they had
even spoken to each other.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, we've been having an exciting time,"
laughed Roland.</p>

<p>"And what's going to be the end of it?"</p>

<p>"Well, as far as I can gather, the school will meet
without me next September."</p>

<p>"The sack?"</p>

<p>"Well, hardly that; the embroidered bag."</p>

<p>They talked and laughed. Marston was very jolly;
he gave himself no airs, and Roland could hardly realise
that three years ago he had been frightened of him,
that when Marston had passed him in the cloister he
had lowered his voice, and as often as not had stopped
speaking till he had gone by.</p>

<p>"And what's going to happen to you now?" asked
Marston.</p>

<p>"That's just what I don't know. My pater talked
about my going into a bank."</p>

<p>"But you'd hate that, wouldn't you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm not too keen on it."</p>

<p>"Lord, no! I should think not. And there's no
real future in it. You ought to go into the City. There's
excitement there, and big business. You don't want
to waste your life like that."</p>

<p>It happens sometimes that we meet a person whom
we seem to have known all our life, and by the time the
clock began to strike the quarter, Roland felt that he
and Marston were old friends.</p>

<p>"A good fellow that," said Marston, after he had
gone, "and a bit of a sport too, by all accounts. I
must try and see more of him."</p>

<p>And in his study Roland had picked up a calendar
and was counting the days that lay between him and
Freedom.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a></h3>

<p class="subtitle">A FORTUNATE MEETING</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Mr Whately's</span> one idea on his return to
Hammerton was to hide the fact that Roland's
sudden leaving was the result of a scandal.
He wished the decision in no way to seem unpremeditated.
Two days later, therefore, he went round
to the Curtises' and prepared the way by a discussion
of the value of university training.</p>

<p>"Really, you know, Mrs Curtis," he said, "I very
much doubt whether Oxford is as useful as we sometimes
think it is. What will Roland be able to do afterwards?
If I know Roland he will do precious little
work. He is not very clever; I doubt if he will get
into the Civil Service, and what else is there open to
him? Nothing, perhaps, except schoolmastering, and
he would not be much use at that. I am not at all
certain that it is not wiser, on the whole, to take a
boy away at about seventeen or eighteen, send him
abroad for a couple of months and then put him into
business."</p>

<p>Mrs Curtis was not a little surprised. For a good
sixteen years Mr Whately had refused to consider the
possibility of any education for Roland other than
Fernhurst and Brasenose.</p>

<p>"But you are not thinking of taking him away from
Fernhurst and not sending him to Brasenose?" she
said.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Mrs Curtis, but I have been thinking that
if we could do things all over again I am not at all sure
but that's not the way I should have arranged his
education."</p>

<p>That was the first step.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>A few nights later he came round again, and again
talked of the value of two or three months in France.</p>

<p>"What does Roland think about it, Mr Whately?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact, I only heard from Roland on
the subject to-day; he seems quite keen on it. I just
threw it out as a suggestion to him. I pointed out that
most of his friends will have left at the end of the term,
that next year he would be rather lonely, and that there
would not be anything very much for him to do when
he came down from Oxford. He seemed to agree with
me."</p>

<p>Mrs Curtis, however, was no fool. She had spent
the greater part of her middle age sitting in front of a
fire watching life drift past her, and her one amusement
had been the examination of the motives and actions of
her friends.</p>

<p>"There is something rather curious here," she said
that evening to her husband. "As long as we have
known the Whatelys they have insisted on the value of
public school and university education. Now, quite
suddenly, they have turned round, and they are talking
about business and commerce and the value of French."</p>

<p>Mr Curtis, who was a credulous creature, saw no
reason why they should not change their minds if they
wanted to.</p>

<p>"After all," he said, "it is quite true that Latin and
Greek are of very little use to anyone in the City."</p>

<p>But Mrs Curtis refused to be convinced.</p>

<p>"I do not care what you say," she said. "You just
wait and see."</p>

<p>And, sure enough, within a week Mr Whately had
confessed his intention of taking Roland away from
Fernhurst at the end of the term.</p>

<p>"And you are going to send him to France?" said
Mrs Curtis.</p>

<p>"I am not quite certain about that," he said.
"I am going to look round first to see if I can't get him
a job at once. We both agree that another year at
Fernhurst would be a waste of time."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs Curtis smiled pleasantly. As soon as he had
gone she expressed herself forcibly.</p>

<p>"I do not believe for a moment," she insisted, "that
Mr Whately has changed his mind without some pretty
strong reason. He was frightfully anxious to see
Roland captain of his house. He was so proud of
everything he did at Fernhurst. There must be a row
or something; unless, of course, he has lost his money."</p>

<p>But that idea Mr Curtis pooh-poohed.</p>

<p>"My dear Edith," he said, "that is quite impossible.
You know that Whately's got a good salaried post in
the bank. He has got no private means to lose and he
is not the sort of man to live above his income. It is
certainly not money. I don't see why a man should
not change his mind if he wants to."</p>

<p>Mrs Curtis again refused to be convinced.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't," she said.</p>

<p>April was of the same opinion. She knew perfectly
well that Roland, of his own free will, would never have
agreed to such a plan. There must be trouble of some
sort or other, she said to herself, and Roland instantly
became more interesting in her eyes. She wondered
what he had done. Her knowledge of school life was
based mainly upon the stories of Talbot Baines Reid,
and she began to picture some adventure in which he
had taken the blame upon his own shoulders. A friend
of his had contracted liabilities at the Eversham Arms
and Roland had become involved; or perhaps someone
had endeavoured to steal the papers of a Scholarship
examination and Roland had been falsely accused.
She could not imagine that Roland had himself done
anything dishonourable, and she could not be expected
to know the usual cause for which boys are suddenly
removed from their school. Ralph Richmond was the
only person who was likely to know the true story,
and to him she went.</p>

<p>Now, there is in the Latin Grammar a morality contained
in an example of a conditional sentence which
runs in the following words:&mdash;"Even though they are
silent they say enough." In spite of Ralph's desperate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
efforts to assume ignorance it was quite obvious to
April that he knew all about it, also that it was something
that Roland would not want her to know. She
was puzzled and distressed. If there had been no
embarrassment between them during the holidays she
would probably have written to Roland and asked him
about it, but under the conditions she felt that this was
impossible.</p>

<p>"I shall have to wait till he returns," she said.
"Perhaps he will tell me of his own accord."</p>

<p>But when Roland came home he showed not the
slightest inclination to tell her anything. If he were
acting a part he was acting it extraordinarily well. He
told her how glad he was that he was leaving Fernhurst.
"One outgrows school," he said. "It is all right for a
bit. It is great fun when you are a fag and when you
are half-way up; but it is not worth it when you have
got responsibilities. And as I went there at thirteen&mdash;a
year earlier than most people&mdash;nearly all my friends
will have left. I should have been very lonely next
term. I think I am well out of it."</p>

<p>April reminded him of his eagerness to go to Oxford.
That objection, too, he managed to brush aside.</p>

<p>"Oxford," he said; "that is nothing but school over
again. It is masters and work and regulations. I am
very glad it is over."</p>

<p>For a while she was almost tempted to believe he was
telling her the truth, but as August passed she noticed
that Roland seemed less satisfied with his prospects.
He spoke with diminishing enthusiasm of the freedom
of an office. Indeed, whenever she introduced the
subject he changed it quickly.</p>

<p>"I expect father will find me something decent
soon," he would say, and began to talk of cricket or of
some rag that he remembered.</p>

<p>But Mr Whately was not finding it easy to procure
a post for his son. Roland, after all, possessed no
special qualifications. He had been in the Sixth Form
of a public school, but he had not been a particularly
brilliant member of it. He had passed no standard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
examinations. He was too young for any important
competitive work and Mr Whately had very few influential
friends. Roland began to see before him the
prospect of long days spent in a bank&mdash;a dismal
prospect. "What will it lead to, father?" he used to
ask, and Mr Whately had not been able to hold out very
much encouragement.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose in time if you work well you would
become a manager. If you do anything brilliant you
might be given some post of central organisation."</p>

<p>"But it is not very likely, is it, father?" said Roland.</p>

<p>"Not very likely; no."</p>

<p>The years seemed mapped out before him and he
found it difficult to maintain his pose of complacent
satisfaction, so that one evening, when he felt more
than ordinarily depressed, and when the need of sympathy
became irresistible, he found himself telling April
the story of his trouble.</p>

<p>She listened to him quietly, sitting huddled up in the
window-seat, her knees drawn up towards her, her
hands clasped beneath them. She said nothing for a
while after he had finished.</p>

<p>"Well," he said at last, "that's the story. You
know all about it now."</p>

<p>She looked up at him. There was in her eyes neither
annoyance nor repulsion nor contempt, but only
interest and sympathy.</p>

<p>"Why did you do it, Roland?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he said. And because this
happened to be the real reason, and because he felt it
to be inadequate, he searched his memory for some
more plausible account.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he said. "It seemed to happen
this way. Things were awfully dull at school, and then,
during the Christmas holidays, we had that row. If it
hadn't been for that I think I should have chucked it
up altogether. But you didn't seem to care for me;
it didn't seem to matter much either way; and&mdash;well
one drifts into these things."</p>

<p>There was another pause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I don't understand, Roland. Do you mean to
say if we hadn't had that row at Christmas nothing of
this would have happened?"</p>

<p>Because their disagreement had not been without
its influence on Roland's general attitude towards his
school romance, and because Roland was always at the
mercy of the immediate influence, and in the presence
of April was unable to think that anything but April
could have influenced him, he mistook the part for the
whole, and assured her that if they had not had that
quarrel at the dance he would have given up Dolly
altogether. And because the situation was one they
had often met in plays and stories they accepted it as
the truth.</p>

<p>"It's all my fault," she said, "really all my fault."
And turning her head away from him she allowed her
thoughts to travel back to that ineffectual hour of
loneliness and resignation. "I can do nothing, nothing
myself," she said. "I can only spoil things for other
people."</p>

<p>At the time Roland was disappointed, but two hours
later he decided that he was, on the whole, relieved that
Mrs Curtis should have chosen that particular moment
to return from her afternoon call. In another moment
he would have been saying things that would have
complicated life most confoundedly. April had been
very near to tears; he disliked heroics. He would
have had to do something to console her. He would
probably have said to her a great many things that at
the time would have seemed to him true, but which
afterwards he would have regretted. He had sufficient
worries of his own already.</p>

<p>At home life was not made easy for Roland. He
received little sympathy. Ralph told him that he
deserved all he had got and had been lucky to get off
so cheaply. His father repeated a number of moral
platitudes, the source of which Roland was able to
recognise.</p>

<p>"After all," said Mr Whately, "I have been in a
bank all my life; I have not done badly in it, and you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
with your education and advantages, should be able to
do much better."</p>

<p>This was a line of argument which did not appeal to
Roland. He was very fond of his father, but he had
always regarded his manner of life as a fate, at all costs,
to be avoided. And though his mother in his presence
endeavoured to make him believe that all was for the
best in the best of all possible worlds, when she was
alone with her husband she saw only her son's point of
view.</p>

<p>"If this is all we have got to offer him," she said,
"all the money and time we have spent will be wasted.
If a desk at a bank is going to be the end of it, he might
just as well have gone to a day school, and all the extra
money we have spent could have been put away for him
in a bank."</p>

<p>Mr Whately reminded her that the change in their
plans was due entirely to Roland.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes, yes," she said, "that is all very
well. But it is a cruel shame that a boy's whole life
should depend on a thing he does when he is seventeen
years old."</p>

<p>Mr Whately murmured something about it being
the way of the world, adding he himself had been in a
bank now for thirty years.</p>

<p>"Which is the very reason," said Mrs Whately,
"that I don't want my son to go into one"&mdash;an
argument that did not touch her husband.</p>

<p>But talk how they might, and whatever philosophic
attitude they might adopt, the practical position remained
unchanged. Roland had been offered a post
in a bank, which he could take up at the beginning of
October. Three weeks were left him in which he might
try to find something better for himself; but of this
there seemed little prospect.</p>

<p>And as he sat in the free seats at the Oval, on an
afternoon of late September, Roland had to face his
position honestly, and own to himself there was no
alternative to the bank.</p>

<p>He was lonely as he sat there in the mild sunshine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
watching the white figures move across the grass.
That evening school would be going back and he
would not be with them. It was hard to realise that
in four hours' time the cloisters would be alive with
voices, that feet would be clattering up and down the
study steps, that the eight-fifteen would have just
arrived and the rush to the hall would have begun.</p>

<p>The play became slow; two professionals were
wearing down the bowling. He began to feel sleepy in
the languid atmosphere of this late summer afternoon.
He could not concentrate his attention upon the cricket.
He could think only of himself, and the river that was
bearing him without his knowledge to a country he did
not know.</p>

<p>It was not merely that he had left school, that he had
exchanged one discipline for another; he had altered
entirely his mode of life, and for this new life a new
technique would be required. Up till now everything
had been marked out clearly in definite stages; he had
been working in definite lines. It was not merely that
the year was divided into terms, but his career also was
so divided. There had been a gradation in everything.
It had been his ambition to get his firsts at football,
and the path was marked out clearly for him&mdash;house
cap., seconds, firsts: in form he had wanted to get into
the Sixth, and here again the course had been clear&mdash;Fourth,
Fifth, Sixth: he had wanted to become a
house prefect; the process was the same&mdash;day room
table, Lower Fourth table, Fifth Form table, Sixth Form
table. He had known exactly what he was doing;
everything had been made simple for him. His ambitions
had been protected. It was quite different now:
nothing was clearly defined. He would have to spend
a certain number of hours a day in an office. Outside
of that office he would be free to do what he liked. He
could choose his own ambition, but as yet he could not
decide what that would be. He was as dazed by the
imminence of this freedom as a mortal man whose
World is ordered by the limits of time and space when
confronted suddenly with the problem of infinity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Roland could not come to terms with a world in which
he would not be tethered to one spot by periods of
three months. His reverie was interrupted by a hand
that descended heavily on his shoulder and a voice
he recognised, that addressed him by his name. He
turned and saw Gerald Marston standing behind
him.</p>

<p>"So you are a free man at last," he said. "How did
the rest of the term go?"</p>

<p>It was a pleasant surprise; and Roland welcomed
the prospect of a cheery afternoon with a companion
who would soon dispel his melancholy.</p>

<p>"Oh, not so badly," he said. "I lay pretty quiet
and saw as little of Carus Evans as I could."</p>

<p>"And how is the amiable Brewster?" asked Marston.</p>

<p>"He's all right, I suppose. He won't have much of
a time this year, though, I should think. He ought
to have been captain of the XI., but they say now he
is not responsible enough, and Jenkins, a man he
absolutely hates, is going to run it instead."</p>

<p>"So you're not sorry you have left?"</p>

<p>Roland shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"In a way not; if there hadn't been a row, though,
I should have had a pretty good time this term."</p>

<p>"Well, you can't have things both ways. What's
going to happen to you now?"</p>

<p>With most people Roland would have preferred to
pass the matter off with some casual remark about his
father having got him a good job in the City. He liked
sympathy, but was afraid of sympathy when it became
pity. He did not want the acquaintances who, six
months ago, had been talking of him as "that lucky
little beast, Whately," to speak of him now as "poor
old Whately; rotten luck on him; have you heard
about it?" But it is always easier to make a confession
to a stranger than to a person with whom one is
brought into daily contact. Marston was a person with
whom he felt intimate although he knew him so little;
and so he found himself telling Marston about the bank
and of the dismal future that awaited him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Marston was highly indignant.</p>

<p>"What a beastly shame," he said. "You will
simply hate it. Cannot your father get you something
better?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so. He has always lived a very quiet
life; he has not got any influential friends&mdash;but really,
what's the good of talking about it? Something may
turn up. Let's watch the cricket."</p>

<p>"Oh, rot, man!" expostulated Marston. "You
can't let the thing drop like this. After all, my father
is rather a big pot in the varnish world; he may be able
to do something."</p>

<p>"But I don't know anything about varnish."</p>

<p>"You don't need to, my dear fellow. The less you
know about it the better. All you've got to do is to
believe that our kind of varnish is the best." And as
they walked round the ground during the tea interval
a happy idea occurred to Marston.</p>

<p>"I've got it," he said. "We have got a cricket
match on Saturday against the village; we're quite
likely to be a man short; at any rate we can always
play twelve-a-side. You come down and stay the
week-end with us. The pater's frightfully keen on
cricket. If you can manage to make a few he's sure to
be impressed, and then I'll tell him all about you. You
will get a pleasant week-end and I expect quite a good
game of cricket."</p>

<p>Roland naturally accepted this proposal eagerly.
He did not, however, tell his people of the prospect of a
job in Marston &amp; Marston, Limited; he preferred to
wait till things were settled one way or another. If
he were to be disappointed, he would prefer to be disappointed
alone. He did not need any sympathy at
such a time.</p>

<p>But when he went round to the Curtises' April could
tell, from the glow in his face, that he was unusually
excited about something. She did not have a chance to
speak to him when he was in the drawing-room. Her
mother talked and talked. Arthur had just gone back
to school and she was garrulous about his outfit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is so absurd, you know, Mr Whately," she said,
"the way people say women care more about clothes
than men. There is Arthur to-day; he insisted on
having linen shirts instead of woollen ones, although
woollen shirts are much nicer and much warmer.
'My dear Arthur,' I said, 'no one can see your shirt;
your waistcoat hides most of it and your tie the rest.'
But he said that all the boys wore linen shirts instead
of flannel. 'But, my dear Arthur,' I said, 'who is
going to see what kind of a shirt you are wearing if it
is covered by your waistcoat and tie? And I can cut
your sleeves shorter so that they would not be seen
beneath your coat.' And do you know what he said,
Mr Whately? He said, 'You don't understand,
mother; the boys would see that I was wearing a
flannel shirt when I changed for football, and I would
be ragged for it.' Well, now, Mr Whately, isn't that
absurd?"</p>

<p>She went on talking and talking about every garment
she had bought for her son&mdash;his ties, his boots, his
socks, his coat.</p>

<p>Roland hardly talked at all. His father mentioned
that he was going down for the week-end to stay with
some friends and take part in a cricket match.</p>

<p>"So that is what you are so excited about!" April
had interposed. And Roland had laughed and said
that that was it.</p>

<p>But she would not believe that he could be so excited
about a game of cricket, and in the hall she had pulled
him by his coat sleeve.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she had whispered. "Something has
happened. It is not only a cricket match."</p>

<p>And because he wanted to share his enthusiasm with
someone, and because April looked so pretty, and
because he felt that courage would flow to him from
her faith in him, he confided in her his hope.</p>

<p>"Oh, that would be lovely," she said. "I do hope
things will turn out all right. I've felt so guilty all
along about it; if it hadn't been for me none of this
would ever have happened."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't worry about that," said Roland. "Things
are beginning to turn right now."</p>

<p>There was no time for further conversation; Mrs
Curtis had completed her doorstep homily to Mr
Whately. April pressed Roland's hand eagerly as she
said good-bye to him.</p>

<p>"Good luck!" she whispered.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>




<h3><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a></h3>

<p class="subtitle">HOGSTEAD</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span> was a glorious week, and through Thursday and
Friday Roland watched in nervous anticipation
every cloud that crossed the pale blue sky. Sooner
or later the weather must break, he felt; and it
would be fatal for his prospects if it rained now. It
is miserable to sit in a pavilion and watch the wicket
slowly become a bog: cheeriness under such conditions
is anti-social. Mr Marston would be unable to work
up any sympathy for him, and would remember him
as "that fellow who came down for the cricket match
that was such a fiasco"&mdash;an unfortunate association.</p>

<p>Everything went well, however. Roland travelled
down on the Friday night, and as he got out of the
train at Hogstead station he saw the spire of the church
black against a green and scarlet sky. "With such a
sky it can hardly be wet to-morrow," he said.</p>

<p>The Marstons were a rich family and it was the first
time Roland had seen anything of the life of really
wealthy people. He was met at the station and was
driven up through a long, curving drive to a Georgian
house surrounded by well-kept lawns. Marston received
him in a large, oak-panelled hall, and although
at first Roland was a little embarrassed by the attentions
of the footman, who took his hat and coat and
bag, within five minutes he found himself completely
at his ease, sitting in a deep arm-chair discussing with
Mr Marston the prospects of a certain young cricketer
who had made his first appearance that summer at the
Oval.</p>

<p>Mr Marston was a fine healthy man, in the autumn
of life. The enthusiasm of his early years had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
spent in a bitter struggle to build up his business and
he had had very little time for amusement. During the
long hours at his desk and the long evenings with ledgers
and account-books piled before him he had looked forward
to the days when he would be able to delegate his
authority and spend most of his time in the country,
within the sound of bat and ball. Having had little
coaching he was himself a poor performer; for which
reason he was the more kindly disposed to anyone
who showed promise. It was a rule of his estate
that, winter as well as summer, every gardener, groom
and servant should spend ten minutes each morning
bowling at the nets. He lived in the hope that one
day an under-gardener would be deemed worthy of
transportation to the county ground.</p>

<p>"My son tells me you are a great performer," he
said to Roland.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir; only very moderate. I did not get
into the first XI. at Fernhurst."</p>

<p>"They had an awfully strong XI.," interposed
Marston. "And he had a blooming good average for
the second. Didn't you make a century against the
town?"</p>

<p>Roland confessed that he had, but remarked that
with such bowling it was very hard to do anything else.</p>

<p>"Well, ten other people managed to," said Marston.</p>

<p>"And a century is a century whoever makes it,"
said his father, who had never made as many as fifty in
his life. "You've got to make a lot of good shots to
make a hundred."</p>

<p>"At any rate," said Marston, "I don't mind betting
he gets a few to-morrow."</p>

<p>And for half-an-hour they exchanged memories of the
greatest of all games.</p>

<p>Roland found his evening clothes neatly laid out on his
bed when he went up to change for dinner; and when
he came down the whole family was assembled in the
drawing-room. There were Mrs Marston, a large rather
plump woman of about fifty years old; her daughter
Muriel, a small and pretty girl, with her light hair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
scattered over her shoulders; and two or three other
members of the next day's side. There was an intimate
atmosphere of comfort and well-being to which Roland
was unaccustomed. At home they had only one
servant, and had to wait a good deal upon themselves.
He enjoyed the silent, unobtrusive methods of the two
men who waited on them. He never needed to ask
for anything; as soon as he had finished his bread
another piece was offered him; his glass was filled as
it began to empty; and the conversation was like the
meal&mdash;calm, leisured, polished.</p>

<p>Roland sat next to Muriel and found her a delightful
companion. She was at an age when school and games
filled her life completely. She told Roland of a rag
that they had perpetrated on their French mistress,
and he recounted her the exploits of one Foster, who
used to dress up at night, go down to the Eversham
Arms, sing songs and afterwards pass round the hat.</p>

<p>Roland had his doubts as to the existence of Foster;
he had become at Fernhurst one of those mythical
creatures which every school possesses&mdash;a fellow who
took part in one or two amusing escapades, and around
whose name had accumulated the legends of many
generations. His story was worth telling, none the less.</p>

<p>After dinner they walked out into the garden, with
the chill of the autumn night in the air. It reminded
Roland that his sojourn in that warmly coloured life
was only temporary, and that outside it was the cold,
cheerless struggle for existence.</p>

<p>"It is so ripping this," he said to Muriel, "and it is
so rotten to think that in a few weeks I shall be sitting
down in front of a desk and adding up figures." He
told her, though she was already acquainted with the
facts, of how he had left Fernhurst at the end of the
term, and in a few weeks would be going into a bank.</p>

<p>"Oh, how beastly," she said. "I suppose you will
have rotten short holidays?"</p>

<p>"A fortnight a year."</p>

<p>"I think it is a shame," she said. "I am sure a boy
like you ought to be leading an open-air life somewhere."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>And that night, before he fell asleep, Roland thought
wistfully of the company he had met that day. It was
marvellous how money smoothed everything. It was
the oil that made the cogs in the social machine revolve;
without it there was no rhythm or harmony, but only
a broken, jarring movement. Without money he felt
life must be always in a degree squalid. He remembered
his own home and the numerous worries about
small accounts and small expenses; he knew how it
had worn down the energy of his father. He knew that
such worries would never touch a girl like Muriel.
How easy and good-natured all these people were; they
were flowers that had been grown in a fertile soil.
Everything depended upon the soil in which one was
planted; the finest plants would wither if they grew
far from the sunshine in a damp corner of a field.</p>

<p>Next day Roland awoke to a world heavy with a
dripping golden mist, that heralded a bright hot day.
There had been a heavy dew, and after breakfast they
all walked down to the ground to look at the wicket.</p>

<p>"If we win the toss to-day, Gerald," said Mr Marston
to his son, "I think we had better put them in first. It
is bound to play a bit trickily for the first hour or so."</p>

<p>There was no need for such subtlety, however, for the
village won the toss, and, as is the way with villagers,
decided to go in first.</p>

<p>"Good," said Mr Marston, "and if we have not got
eight of them out by lunch I shall be very surprised."</p>

<p>And, sure enough, eight of the village were out by
lunch, but the score had reached one hundred and five.
This was largely due to three erratic overs that had been
sent down by an ecclesiastical student from Wells who
had bowled, perhaps in earnest of future compromise,
on the leg theory, with his field placed upon the off.</p>

<p>The local butcher had collected some thirty runs off
these three overs, and thirty runs in a village match
when the whole score of a side does not usually reach
more than fifty or sixty is a serious consideration.</p>

<p>At lunch-time Mr Marston was most apologetic. "I
had heard he was a good bowler," he said to Roland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
"and I thought it would be a good thing to give him a
chance to bowl early on; and then when I saw him
getting hit all over the place I imagined he was probably
angling for a catch or something; and then after he had
been hit about in the first two overs I had to give him
a third for luck."</p>

<p>"An expensive courtesy," said Roland.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it was; but, after all, a hundred and five
is not a great deal, and we have a good many bats on
our side."</p>

<p>Within half-an-hour's time a hundred and five for
eight had become a hundred and fifty. Under the
kindly influence of his excellent champagne-cup Mr
Marston had decided to give the ecclesiastical student
another opportunity of justifying his reputation. He
did not redeem that reputation. He sent down two
overs, which resulted&mdash;in addition to three wides and a
"no ball"&mdash;in twenty-five runs; and a hundred and
fifty would take a lot of getting. Indeed, Mr Marston's
XI. never looked at all like getting them.</p>

<p>Roland, who was sent in first, was caught at short
leg in the second over; it was off a bad ball and a worse
stroke&mdash;a slow, long hop that he hit right across, and
skied. He was bitterly disappointed. He did not
mind making ducks; it was all in the run of a game,
and he never minded if he was got out by a good ball.
But it was hard on such a day to throw away one's
wicket.</p>

<p>"Very bad luck indeed," said Muriel, as he reached
the pavilion.</p>

<p>"Not bad luck, bad play!" he remarked good-humouredly.
Having taken off his pads he sat down
beside her and watched the game. It was not particularly
exciting; wickets fell with great regularity.
Mr Marston made a few big hits, and his son stayed in
for a little while without doing anything much more
than keep his end up. In the end the total reached a
hundred and thirteen, and in a one-day match a first
innings result was usually final. But Mr Marston
was not at all despondent. He refused to wait for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the tea interval and led his side straight on to the
field.</p>

<p>"We don't want any rest," he said. "Most of us
have rested the whole afternoon, and those of the other
side who are not batting can have tea."</p>

<p>It was now four-thirty; two hours remained before
the drawing of stumps, and from now on the game
became really exciting. Marston took two wickets in
his first over, and at the other end a man was run out.
Three wickets were down for two runs: a panic descended
upon the villagers. The cobbler was sent in
to join the doctor, with strict instructions not to hit
on any account. The cobbler was not used to passive
resistance; he played carefully for a couple of overs,
then a faster ball from Marston found the edge of the
bat. Short slip was for him, providentially, asleep,
and the umpire signalled a four. This seemed to throw
him off his balance.</p>

<p>"It is no good," he said. "If I start mucking about
like that I don't stand the foggiest chance of sticking
in. I'm going to have a hit."</p>

<p>At the next ball he did have a hit&mdash;right across it,
and his middle stump fell flat.</p>

<p>After this there was no serious attempt to wear down
the bowling. Rustic performers&mdash;each with a style
more curious than the last&mdash;drove length balls on the
off stump in the direction of long on. Wickets fell
quickly. The score rose; and by the time the innings
was over only an hour was left for play, and ninety-two
runs were required to win&mdash;ninety-two runs against
time in a fading light, on a wicket that had been torn
up by hob-nailed boots, was not the easiest of tasks.</p>

<p>"Still, we must have a shot for it," Mr Marston said.
"We cannot be more than beaten, and we are that
already."</p>

<p>And so Gerald Marston and Roland went in to open
the innings with the firm intention of getting on or
getting out.</p>

<p>The start was sensational. Marston had few pretensions
to style; and indeed his unorthodox, firm-footed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
drive had been the despair of the Fernhurst Professional.
The ball, when he hit it, went into the air far more often
than along the ground. And probably no one was more
surprised than he was when he hit the first two balls
that he received right along the ground to the boundary,
past cover-point. The third ball was well up: he took
a terrific drive at it, missed it, and was very nearly
bowled. Roland, who was backing up closely, called
him for a run, and if surprise at so unparalleled an
example of impertinence had not rendered the wicket-keeper
impotent, nothing could have saved him from
being run out. A fever entered into Roland's brain.
He knew quite well that he ought to play carefully for
a few balls to get his eye in, but that short run had
flung him off his balance. The first ball he received he
hit at with a horizontal bat, and it sailed, fortunately
for him, over cover-point's head for two. He attempted
a similar stroke at the next ball, was less fortunate, and
saw cover-point prepare himself for an apparently easy
catch. But there is a kindly Providence which guards
the reckless.</p>

<p>Cover-point was the doctor, and probably the safest
man in the whole field to whom to send a catch. He
was not, however, proof against the impetuous ardour
of mid-off. Mid-off saw the ball in the air and saw
nothing else. He rushed to where it was about to fall.
He arrived at the spot just when the doctor's hands
were preparing a comfortable nest for the ball, and the
doctor and mid-off fell in a heap together, with the ball
beneath them!</p>

<p>Twelve runs had been scored in the first five balls;
there had been a possible run out; a catch had been
missed at cover-point. It was a worthy start to a
great innings.</p>

<p>After that everything went right with Roland. He
attempted and brought off some remarkably audacious
shots. He let fly at everything that was at all pitched
up to him. Sometimes he hit the ball in the centre of
the bat, and it sailed far into the long field; but even
his mishits were powerful enough to lift the ball out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
reach of the instanding fieldsman: and fortune was
kind. By the time Marston was caught at the wicket
the score had reached fifty-seven, and there were still
twenty-five minutes left for play. At the present rate
of scoring there would be no difficulty in getting the
runs. At this point, however, a misfortune befell them.</p>

<p>In the first innings the ecclesiastical student had
made a duck; he had not, indeed, received a single ball.
His predecessor had been bowled by the last ball of an
over, and off the first ball of the next over the man at
the other end had called him for an impossible run and
he had been run out. To recompense him for this ill
luck Mr Marston had put him in first wicket down.
"After all," he had said, "we ought to let the man
have a show, and if he does make a duck it won't make
any difference." He was not prepared, however, for
what did occur. The ecclesiastical student was a left-handed
batsman, and a sigh of relief seemed to go up
from the fielding side at the revelation. They were
sportsmen; they were prepared to run across in the
middle of the over; but even so, the preparation of a
field for a left-hander was a lengthy business.</p>

<p>A grey gloom descended on the pavilion.</p>

<p>"Well, I declare!" said Mr Marston. "First of all
he bowls on the leg theory, with his field placed on the
off, and then at a moment like this he doesn't let us
know that he's a left-hander!"</p>

<p>And the prospective divine appeared to be quite
unconscious of the situation. He had come out to
enjoy himself; so far he had not enjoyed himself
greatly. He had taken no wickets, and had been
responsible for the loss of some fifty runs. This was
his last chance, and he was not going to hurry himself.
He played his first three balls carefully, and placed the
last ball of the over in front of short leg for a single.
During the next four overs only eight runs were scored;
four of these were from carefully placed singles, off the
fifth and sixth balls in the over. Roland only had
three balls altogether, and off one of these he managed
to get a square leg boundary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>The total had now reached sixty-five, twenty-eight
runs were still wanted, and only a quarter of an hour
remained. Unless the left-hander were got out at once
there seemed to be no chance of winning; this fact the
village appreciated.</p>

<p>One would not say, of course, that the bowlers did
not do their best to dismiss the ecclesiastical student;
they were conscientious men. But it is very hard to
bowl one's best if one knows that one's success will be
to the eventual disadvantage of one's side; a certain
limpness is bound to creep into the attack. And if
Roland had received the balls that were being sent
down to his partner, there is little doubt that a couple
of overs would have seen the end of the match.</p>

<p>Roland realised that something desperate must be
done. Either the left-hander must get out, or he himself
must get down to the other end; and so off the
first ball of the next over Roland backed up closely.
He was half-way down the pitch by the time the ball
reached the batsman. It was a straight half-volley,
which was met with a motionless, if perpendicular, bat.
The ball trickled into the hands of mid-off.</p>

<p>"Come on!" yelled Roland.</p>

<p>It was an impossible run, and the left-hander stood,
in startled dismay, a few steps outside the crease.</p>

<p>"Run!" yelled Roland. His partner ran a few
steps, saw the ball was in the hands of mid-off, and
prepared to walk back to the pavilion. Mid-off, however,
was in a highly electric state. He had already
imperilled severely the prospects of his side by colliding
with cover-point, and was resolved, at any rate, not to
make a second blunder. He had the ball in his hands.
There was a chance of running a batsman out; he must
get the ball to the unprotected wicket as soon as
possible, and so, taking careful aim, he flung the ball
at the wicket with the greatest possible violence. It
missed the wicket; and a student of the score-book
would infer that, after having played himself in carefully
and scoring four singles, F. R. Armitage opened
his shoulders in fine form. He might very well remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
in this illusion, for there is no further entry in the
score-book against that gentleman's name. There are
just four singles and a five. He did not receive another
ball.</p>

<p>Off the next four balls of the over Roland hit
two fours and a two; off the last ball he got another
dangerously close single. Only ten more runs were
needed: there was now ample time in which to get
them. Roland got them indeed off the first four balls
of the next over.</p>

<p>At the end of the match there was a scene of real
enthusiasm, in which Mr Armitage was the only person
who took no part. He was still wondering what had
induced Roland to call him for those absurd singles.
He indeed took Mr Marston aside after dinner and
pointed out to him that that young man should really
be given a few lessons in backing up.</p>

<p>"My dear sir," he said, "it was only the merest
fluke that saved my wicket&mdash;another inch and I should
have been run out."</p>

<p>"Well, he managed to win the match for us," replied
Mr Marston.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, perhaps, but he nearly ran me out."</p>

<p>Mr Armitage was, however, the only one of the party
at all alarmed by Roland's daring. That evening
Roland was a small hero. Mr Marston could find no
words too good for him.</p>

<p>"A splendid fellow," he said to Gerald afterwards.
"A really splendid fellow&mdash;the sort of friend I have
always wanted you to make&mdash;a first-class, open, straight
fellow."</p>

<p>Marston thought this a good opportunity to drop a
hint about Roland's position.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;a first-class fellow," he said. "Isn't it
rotten to think a chap like that will have to spend the
whole of his life in a bank, with only a fortnight's holiday
a year, and no chance to develop his game!"</p>

<p>Mr Marston's rubicund face expressed appropriate
disapproval.</p>

<p>"That fellow going to spend all his life in a bank?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Preposterous! He will be simply ruined there&mdash;a
fellow who can play cricket like that!"</p>

<p>Mr Marston, having spent his own life at a desk, was
anxious to save anyone else from a similar fate,
especially a cricketer.</p>

<p>"Well, it seems the only thing for him to do, father;
his people haven't got much money and have no influence.
I know they have tried to get him something
better, but they haven't been able to."</p>

<p>"My dear Gerald, why didn't you tell me about it?
If I had known a fellow like that was being tied up in a
bank I'd have tried to do something to help him."</p>

<p>"Well, it's not too late now, is it?"</p>

<p>"No, but it's rather short notice, isn't it? What
could he do?"</p>

<p>"Pretty well anything you could give him, father.
He is jolly keen."</p>

<p>"Um!" said Mr Marston; and Gerald, who knew
his father well, recognised that he was about to immerse
himself in deep thought, and that it would be wiser to
leave him alone.</p>

<p>By next morning the deep thought had crystallised
into an idea.</p>

<p>"Look here, Gerald," said Mr Marston. "I don't
know what this young man is worth to me from a
business point of view&mdash;probably precious little at
present. But he is a good fellow, the sort of young
chap we really want in the business. None of us are
any younger than we were. As far as I know, you are
the only person under thirty in the whole show. Now,
what we do want badly just now are a few more foreign
connections. We have got the English market pretty
well, but that is not enough. We want the French and
Belgian and German markets, and later on we shall
want the South American markets. Now, what I
suggest is this: that when you go out to France in
November you should take young Whately with you,
show him round, and see what he is worth generally;
and then we will send him off on a tour of his own and
see how many clients he brings us. He is just the sort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
of fellow I want for that job. We don't want the
commercial traveller type at all; he is very good at
small accounts, but he does not do for the big financiers.
I want a man who is good enough to mix in society
abroad&mdash;whom big men like Bertram can ask to their
houses. A man like that would always have a pull
over a purely business man. Now, if your young
friend would care to have a shot at that, he can; and
if he makes good at it he will be making more at
twenty-five with us than he would be at a bank by the
time he was fifty."</p>

<p>Marston carried the news at once to Roland.</p>

<p>"My lad," he said, "that innings of yours is about
the most useful thing that has ever happened to you in
your life. The old man thinks so much of you he is
prepared to cut me out of his will almost; at any rate,
as far as I can make out, he is going to offer you a job in
our business."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"You will have to fix it up with him, of course, but
he suggested to me that you and I should go out
together to France in November, and you will be able
to see the sort of way we do things, and then he will
give you a shot on your own as representative. If you
do well at it&mdash;well, my lad, you will be pretty well
made for life!"</p>

<p>It was wonderful news for Roland. Life, at the very
moment when it had appeared to be closing in on him,
had marvellously broadened out. He returned home
on the Monday morning, not only excited by the
prospect of a new and attractive job, but moved
irresistibly by this sudden vision of a world to which
he was unaccustomed&mdash;by the charm, the elegance and
the direct good-naturedness of this family life.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a></h3>

<p class="subtitle">YOUNG LOVE</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Roland</span> said nothing to his people of Mr
Marston's conversation with Gerald. He disliked
scenes and an atmosphere of expectation.
When everything was settled finally he would tell them,
but he would not risk the exposure of his hope to the
chill of disappointment. He could not, however, resist
the temptation to confide in April. She was young;
she could share his failures as his successes. Life was
before them both.</p>

<p>No sooner had he turned the corner of the road than
he saw the door of the Curtises' house open. April was
in the porch waiting for him. "She must have been
looking for me," he thought. "Sitting in the window-seat,
hoping that I should come." His pride as well as
his affection was touched by this clear proof of her
interest in him.</p>

<p>"Well?" she said.</p>

<p>"I made a duck," he answered; and his vanity noted
that her brown eyes clouded suddenly with disappointment.
"But that was only in the first innings," he
added.</p>

<p>"Oh, you pig!" she said, "and I thought that after
all it had come to nothing."</p>

<p>Roland laughed at the quick change to relief.</p>

<p>"But how do you know that I did do anything in the
second innings?"</p>

<p>"You must have."</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"'Cos&mdash;oh, I don't know. It's not fair to tease me,
Roland; tell me what happened." They had passed
into the hall, shutting the door behind them, and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
pulled impatiently at his sleeve: "Come on, tell
me."</p>

<p>"Well, as a matter of fact, I made forty-eight not
out."</p>

<p>"Oh, how ripping, how ripping! Come and tell
me all about it," and catching him by the hand she
led him to the window-seat, from which, on that
miserable afternoon, she had gazed for over an hour
down the darkening street. "Come on, tell me
everything."</p>

<p>And though he at first endeavoured to assume an
attitude of superior indifference, he soon found himself
telling the story of the match eagerly, dramatically.
Reticence was well enough in the presence of the old
and middle-aged&mdash;parents, relatives and schoolmasters&mdash;for
all those who had put behind them the thrill of
wakening confidence and were prepared to patronise it
in others, from whose scrutiny the young had to protect
their emotions with the shield of "it is no matter."
But April's enthusiasm was fresh, unquestioning and
freely given; he could not but respond to it.</p>

<p>She listened to the story with alert, admiring eyes.
"And were they awfully pleased with you?" she said
when he had finished.</p>

<p>"Well, it was pretty exciting."</p>

<p>"And did Mr Marston say anything to you?"</p>

<p>"Rather! Quite a lot. He was more excited than
anyone."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, but I didn't mean the cricket. Did he say
anything about the business?"</p>

<p>Roland nodded.</p>

<p>"Oh, but, Roland, what?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not quite certain what, but I think he's
going to let me have a shot at some sort of foreign
representative affair."</p>

<p>"But, how splendid!" She felt that she shared, in
a measure, in his success. It was in her that he had
confided his hopes; it was to her that he had brought
the news of his good fortune. Her face was flushed
and eager, its expression softened by her faith in him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
And Roland who, up till then, had regarded her as little
more than a friend, her charm as a delicate, elusive
fragrance, was unprepared for this simple joy in his
achievement. The surprise placed in his mouth ardent,
unconsidered words.</p>

<p>"But I shouldn't have been able to do anything
without you," he said.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she asked, feeling herself
grow nervous, taut, expectant.</p>

<p>"You encouraged me when I was depressed," he said.
"You believed in me. You told me that things would
come right. And because of your belief they have come
right. If it hadn't been for you I shouldn't have
worried; I should have resigned myself to the bank.
As likely as not I shouldn't have gone down to the
Marstons' at all. It's all you."</p>

<p>There was a pause. And when at last she spoke, the
intonation of her voice was tender.</p>

<p>"Is that true, Roland, really true?"</p>

<p>And as she looked at him, with her clear brown eyes,
he believed implicitly that it was true. He was not
play-acting. His whole being was softened and made
tender by her beauty, by the sight of her calm, oval
face and quiet colour, her hair swept in a wide curve
across her forehead, gathered under the smooth skin of
her neck. His manhood grew strong through her belief
in him. She was the key that would open for him the
gate of adventure. He leant forward, took her hands
in his, and the touch of her fingers brought to his lips an
immediate avowal.</p>

<p>"It's quite true, April, every word of it. I shouldn't
have done anything but for you." Her brown eyes
clouded with a mute gratitude. Gently he drew her by
the hand towards him, and she made no effort to resist
him. "April," he murmured, "April."</p>

<p>It was the first real kiss of his life. His mouth did
not meet hers as it had met Dolly's, in a hungry fierceness;
he did not hold her in his arms as he had held
Dolly; did not press her to him till she was forced, as
Dolly had, to fling her head back and gasp for breath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>.
For an instant April's cheek was against his and his
mouth touched hers: nothing more. But in that cool
contact of her lips he found for the first time the
romance, poetry, ecstasy, what you will, of love. And
when his arms released her and she leant back, her hand
in his, a deep tenderness remained with them. He
said nothing. There was no need for words. They
sat silent in face of the mystery they had discovered.</p>

<p>Roland walked home in harmony with himself, with
nature; one with the rhythm of life that was made
manifest in the changing seasons of the year; the
green leaf and the bud; the flower and the fruit; the
warm days of harvesting. Hammerton was stretched
languid beneath the September sunshine. The sky was
blue, a pale blue, that whitened where it was cut by the
sharp outline of roof and chimney-stack. The leaves
that had been fresh and green in May, but had grown
dull in the heat and dust of summer, were once more
beautiful. The dirty green had changed to a shrivelled,
metallic copper. A few mornings of golden mist would
break into a day of sultry splendour; then would come
the first warning of frost&mdash;the chill air at sundown, the
grey dawn that held no promise of sunshine. Oh, soon
enough the boughs would be leafless, the streets bare
and wintersome. But who could be sad on this day of
suspended decadence, this afternoon laden with the
heavy autumn scents. Were not the year's decay,
the lengthening evenings, part of the eternal law of
nature&mdash;birth and death, spring and winter, and an
awakening after sleep? The falling leaves suggested
to him no analogy with the elusive enchantments of
the senses.</p>

<p>Two days later he received a letter from Mr Marston
offering him a post of a hundred and fifty pounds a
year, with all expenses found.</p>

<p>"You will understand, of course," the letter ran,
"that at present you are on probation. Our work is
personal and requires special gifts. These gifts, however,
I believe you to possess. For both our sakes I
hope that you will make a success of this. Gerald is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
sailing for Brussels at the end of October, and I expect
that you will be able to arrange to accompany him. He
will tell you what you will need to take out with you.
We usually make our representative an allowance of
fifteen pounds for personal expenses, but I daresay
that we could in your case, if it is necessary, increase
this sum."</p>

<p>Roland handed the letter to his father.</p>

<p>Mr Whately, as usual in the morning, was in a state
of nervous excitement. He was always a considerable
trial to his family at breakfast. And as often as
possible Roland delayed his own appearance till he had
heard the slam of the front door. It is not easy to
enjoy a meal when someone is bouncing from table to
sideboard, reading extracts from the morning paper,
opening letters, running up and down stairs, forgetting
things in the hall. Mr Whately had never been able
to face the first hour of the morning with dignity and
composure. When Roland handed him Mr Marston's
letter he received it with the impatience of a busy man,
who objects to being worried by an absurd trifle.</p>

<p>"Yes, what is it? What is it?"</p>

<p>"A letter from Mr Marston, father, that I thought
you might like to read."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, of course; well, wait a minute," and he
projected himself out of the door and up the stairs.
He returned within a minute, panting and flustered.</p>

<p>"Yes; now what's the time? Twenty-five past
eight. I've got seven minutes. Where's this letter of
yours, Roland? Let me see."</p>

<p>He picked up the letter and began to read it as
he helped himself to another rasher of bacon. His
agitation increased as he read.</p>

<p>"But I don't understand," he said impatiently.
"What's all this about Mr Marston offering you a post
in his business?"</p>

<p>"What's that, dear?" said Mrs Whately quickly.
"Isn't Roland going into the bank after all?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course he is going into the bank," her
husband replied hastily. "It's all settled. Don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
interrupt me, Roland. I can't understand what you've
been doing!"</p>

<p>And he flung the back of his hand against his forehead,
a favourite gesture when the pressure of the
conversation grew intense.</p>

<p>"I don't know what it's all about, Roland," he
continued. "I don't know anything about this man.
Who he is, and what he is. And I don't know why
you've been arranging all these things behind my back."</p>

<p>Roland expressed surprise that his father had not
welcomed the offer of so promising a post. But Mr
Whately was too flustered to consider the matter in
this light. "It may be a better job," he said, "I don't
know. But the bank has been settled and I can't
think why you should want to alter things. At any
rate, I can't stop to discuss it now," and a minute later
the front door had banged behind a querulous, irritable
little man, who considered no one had any right to
disturb&mdash;especially at the breakfast-table&mdash;the placid
course of his existence. As he left the room he flung
the letter upon the table, and Mrs Whately snatched it
up eagerly. Roland watched carefully the expression
of her face as she read it. At first he noted there only
a relieved happiness, but as she folded the letter and
handed it back he saw that she was sad.</p>

<p>"Of course it's splendid, Roland," she said. "I'm
delighted, but.... Oh, well, I do think you might
have told us something about it before."</p>

<p>"I wanted to, mother, but one doesn't like to shout
till one's out of the wood."</p>

<p>"With friends, no, but with one's parents&mdash;surely
you might have confided in us."</p>

<p>There was no such implied disapproval in April's
reception of the news. He had not seen her since the
afternoon when he had kissed her, and he had wondered
in what spirit she would receive him. Would there be
awkward stammered explanations? Would she be coy
and protest "that she had been silly, that she had not
meant it, that it must never happen again?" He
had little previous experience to guide him and he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
still debating the point when he arrived at No. 73
Hammerton Rise.</p>

<p>What April Curtis did was to open the door for him,
close it quickly behind him as soon as he was in the
porch, take him happily by both hands and hold her
face up to be kissed. There was not the least embarrassment
in her action.</p>

<p>"Well?" she said, on a note of interrogation.</p>

<p>For answer he put his hand into his pocket, drew out
Mr Marston's letter and gave it to her.</p>

<p>April pulled it out of the envelope, hurriedly unfolded
it, and ran an engrossed eye over its contents.</p>

<p>"Oh, but how splendid, Roland; now it's all right.
Now there's no need to worry about anything. Come at
once and tell mother. Mother, mother!" she shouted,
and catching Roland by the hand dragged him after her
towards the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Mrs Curtis had, through the laborious passage of fifty-two
uneventful years, so trained her face to assume
on all occasions an expression of pleasant sentimental
interest in the affairs of others that by now her features
could not be arranged to accommodate any other emotion.
She appeared therefore unastonished when her
name was called loudly in the hall, when the drawing-room
door was flung open and a flushed, excited April
stood in the doorway, grasping by the hand an equally
flushed but embarrassed Roland. Mrs Curtis laid her
knitting in her lap; a kindly smile spread over her
glazed countenance.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear, and what's all this about?" she said.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's so exciting, mother. Roland's not going
into a bank after all."</p>

<p>"No, dear?"</p>

<p>"No, mother. A Mr Marston, you know the man
whom Roland went to stay with last week, has offered
him a post in his firm. It's a lovely job. He'll be
travelling all over the world and he's going to get a
salary; of how much is it&mdash;yes, a hundred and fifty
pounds a year and all expenses paid. Isn't it
splendid?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs Curtis purred with reciprocated pleasure: "Of
course it is, and how pleased your parents must be.
Come and sit down here; yes, shut the door, please.
You know I always said to Mr Whately, 'Roland is
going to do something big; I'm sure of it.' And now
you see my prophecy has come true. I shall remind
Mr Whately of that next time he comes round to see me,
and I shall remind him, too, that I said exactly the same
thing about Arthur. 'Mr Whately,' I said," and her
voice trailed off into reminiscences.</p>

<p>But though Mrs Curtis was in many&mdash;and indeed
in most&mdash;ways a troublesome old fool, she was not unobservant.
She knew that a young girl does not rush
into a drawing-room dragging a young man by the hand
simply because that young man has obtained a lucrative
post in a varnish factory. There must be some other
cause for so vigorous an ebullition. And as Mrs Curtis's
speculation was unvexed by the complexities of Austrian
psychology, she assumed that Roland and April had
fallen in love with each other. She was not surprised.
She had indeed often wondered why they had not done
so before. April was such a dear girl, and Roland could
be trained into a highly sympathetic son-in-law. He
listened to her conversation with respect and interest,
whereas Ralph Richmond insisted on interrupting her.
Roland would make April a good husband. Certainly
she had been temporarily disquieted by Mr Whately's
sudden decision to remove his son from school; but no
doubt he had had this post in his mind's eye and had
not wished to speak of it till everything had been fixed.</p>

<p>Mrs Curtis's reverie traversed into an agreeable
future; she pictured the wedding at St Giles; they
would have the full choir. There would be a reception
afterwards at the Town Hall. April would look so
pretty in orange blossom. Arthur would be the best
man. He would stand beside the bridegroom, erect
and handsome. "What fine children you have, Mrs
Curtis!" That's what everyone would say to her.
It would be the prettiest wedding there had ever been
at St Giles.... She collected herself with a start.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
She must not be premature. Nothing was settled yet;
they were not even engaged. And of course they could
not be engaged yet. They were too absurdly young.
Everyone would laugh at her. Still, there might be an
understanding. An understanding was first cousin to
an engagement; it bound both parties. And then April
and Roland would be allowed to go about together.
It would be so nice for them.</p>

<p>When Roland had gone, she fixed on her daughter a
deep, questioning look, under which April began to
grow uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"Well, mother?" she said.</p>

<p>"You like Roland very much, don't you, dear?"</p>

<p>"We're great friends."</p>

<p>"Only friends?"</p>

<p>April did not answer, and her mother repeated her
question. "But you're more than friends, aren't you?"
But April was still silent. Mrs Curtis leant forward
and took April's hand, lifted for a moment out of her
vain complacency by the recollection of herself as she
had been a quarter of a century ago, like April, with life
in front of her. Through placid waters she had come to
a safe anchorage, and she wondered whether for April
the cruise would be as fortunate, the hand at the helm
as steady. Her husband had risked little, but Roland
would scarcely be satisfied with safe travel beneath the
cliffs. Would April be happier or less happy than she
had been? Which was the better&mdash;blue skies, calm
water, gently throbbing engines, or the pitch and toss
and crash of heavy seas?</p>

<p>"Are you very fond of him, dear?" she whispered.</p>

<p>"Yes, mother."</p>

<p>"And he's fond of you?"</p>

<p>"I think so, mother."</p>

<p>"Has he told you so, dear?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>A tear gathered in the corner of her eye, stung her,
welled, fell upon her cheek, and this welcome relief
recalled her to what she considered the necessities of
the moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course I shall have to speak to the Whatelys
about it."</p>

<p>A shocked, surprised expression came into April's face.</p>

<p>"Oh, but why, mother?"</p>

<p>"Because, my dear, they may have other plans for
Roland."</p>

<p>"But ... oh, mother, dear, there's no talk of
engagements or anything; we've just ... oh, why
can't we go on as we are?"</p>

<p>Mrs Curtis was firm.</p>

<p>"No, my dear," she said, "it would be fair neither to
you nor to them. It's not only you and Roland that
have to be considered. There's your father and myself
and Mr and Mrs Whately. We shall have to talk it over
together."</p>

<p>And so when Roland returned that evening from an
afternoon with Ralph he found his father and mother
sitting in the drawing-room with Mrs Curtis.</p>

<p>"Ah, here's Roland," said Mrs Curtis. "Come
along, Roland, we've just been talking about you."</p>

<p>Roland entered and sat on the chair nearest him. He
looked from one to the other, and each in turn smiled at
him reassuringly: their smile said, "Now don't be nervous.
We mean you well. You've only got to agree to
our conditions and we'll be ever so nice to you." In
the same way, Roland reflected, the Spanish Inquisitors
had recommended conversion to the faith with a smile
upon their lips, while from the adjoining room sounds
came that the impenitents would be wise to associate
with furnaces and screws and pliant steel.</p>

<p>"Yes, Roland," said Mr Whately, "we've been
talking about you and April."</p>

<p>"Damn!" said Roland to himself. It was like that
ridiculous Dolly affair all over again. It was useless,
of course, to be flustered. He was growing accustomed
to this sort of scene. He supposed that April had got
frightened and told her mother, or perhaps the maidservant
had seen them kissing in the porch. In any
case it was not very serious. They would probably
forbid him to see April alone. It would be rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
rotten; but the world was wide. In a few weeks' time
he would be going abroad; he could free himself of these
entanglements, and when he returned he would decide
what he should do. He would be economically independent.
In the meantime let them talk. He settled
himself back in his chair and prepared to hear at least,
with patience, whatever they might have to say to him.
What they did have to say came to him as a surprise.</p>

<p>"I was talking to April about it this morning," said
Mrs Curtis. "Of course I've noticed it for a long time.
A mother can't help seeing these things. Several times
I've said to my husband: 'Father, dear, haven't you
noticed that Roland and April are becoming very
interested in each other?' and he's agreed with me.
Though I haven't liked to say anything. But then
this morning it was so very plain, wasn't it?" She
paused and smiled. And Roland, feeling that an
answer was expected of him, said that he supposed
it was.</p>

<p>"Yes, really quite clear, and so afterwards I had a
talk with my little April and she told me all about it.
And, of course, we're all of us very pleased that you
should be fond of one another, but you must realise
that at present you're much too young for there to be
any talk of marriage."</p>

<p>"But..." Roland began.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know that you've got a good post in this
varnish factory; but as I was saying to Mr Whately
before you came, you're only on probation, and it's a
job that means a lot of travelling and expense that you
wouldn't be able to afford if you were a married man
or were even contemplating matrimony."</p>

<p>"But..." Roland began again, and again Mrs
Curtis stopped him.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know what you're thinking; you say that
you are content to wait; that four years, five years, six
years&mdash;it's nothing to you, that you want to be engaged
now. I can quite understand it. We all can. We've
all been young, but I'm quite certain that..."</p>

<p>Roland could not believe that it was real, that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
sitting in a real room, that a real woman was talking,
a real scene was in the process of enaction. He listened
in a stupefied amazement. What, after all, had
happened? He had kissed April three times. She had
asked no vows and he had given none. They were
lovers he supposed, but they were boy and girl lovers.
The romances of the nursery should not be taken
seriously. By holding April's hand and kissing her had
he decided the course of both their lives? What were
they about, these three solemn people, with their talk of
marriage and engagements?</p>

<p>"But you don't understand," he began.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, we do," Mrs Curtis interrupted. "We old
people know more than you think."</p>

<p>And she began to speak in her droning, mellifluous
voice of the sanctity of love and of the good fortune
that had led him so early to his affinity. And then all
three of them began to speak together, and their words
beat like hammers upon Roland's head, till he did not
know where he was, nor what they were saying to him.
"It can't be real," he told himself. "It's preposterous.
People don't behave like this in real life." And
when his mother came across and kissed him on the
forehead and said, "We're all so happy, Roland," he
employed every desperate device to recall himself to
reality that he was accustomed to use when involved in
a nightmare. He fixed his thoughts upon one issue,
focused all his powers on that one point: "I will wake
up. I will wake up."</p>

<p>And even when it was all over, and he was in his bedroom
standing before the looking-glass to arrange his
tie, he could not believe that it had really happened.
It was impossible that grown-up people should be so
foolish. He could understand that Mrs Curtis should
be annoyed at his attentions to her daughter. He had
been prepared for that. If she had said, "Roland,
you're both of you too old for that. It was well enough
when you were both children, but it won't do now;
April is growing up," he could have appreciated her
point of view. Perhaps they were too old for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
love-making of childhood. But that she should take up
the attitude that they were too young for the serious
matrimonial entanglements of man and womanhood!
It was beyond the expectation of any sane intelligence.</p>

<p>In a way he could not help feeling annoyed with
April. If she had not told her mother nothing would
have happened.</p>

<p>"Oh, but how silly," she said, when he told her about
it next day. "I do wish I had been there. It must
have been awfully funny!"</p>

<p>Roland had not considered it in that light and
hastened to tell her so.</p>

<p>"I felt a most appalling fool. It was beastly. I
can't think why you told your mother anything about
it."</p>

<p>She looked up quickly, surprised by the note of
impatience in his voice.</p>

<p>"But, Roland, dear, what else could I do? She
asked me and I couldn't tell a lie. Could I?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Roland. And he began to walk
backwards and forwards, up and down the room. "I
suppose you couldn't help it, but.... Oh, well, what
did you say to her?"</p>

<p>"Nothing much. She asked me.... Oh, but,
Roland, do sit down," she pleaded, "I can't talk when
you're walking up and down the room."</p>

<p>"All right," said Roland, sitting down. "Go on."</p>

<p>"Well, she asked me if I liked you and I said that
we were great friends, and then she asked if we weren't
more than friends."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes, I know," said Roland, rising impatiently
from his chair and walking across the room.
"Of course you said we were, and that I had been
making love to you, and that&mdash;oh, but what's the good
of going on with it. I know what she said and what you
said, and the whole thing was out in three minutes, and
then your mother comes round to my mother and they
talk and they talk, and that's how all the trouble in the
world begins."</p>

<p>While he was actually speaking he was sustained by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the white heat of his impatience, but the moment he had
stopped he was bitterly ashamed of himself. What had
he done? What had he said? And April's silence accentuated
his shame. She neither turned angrily upon
him nor burst into tears. She sat quietly, her hands
clasped in front of her knees, looking at the floor.</p>

<p>After a while she rose and walked across to the
window. Her back was turned to him. He felt that
he must do something to shatter the poignant silence.
He drew close to her and touched her hand with his, but
she drew her hand away quietly, without haste or anger.</p>

<p>"April," he began, "I'm...."</p>

<p>But she stopped him. "Don't say anything. Please
don't say anything."</p>

<p>"But I must, April. I've been a beast. I didn't
mean it."</p>

<p>"It's quite all right. I've been very foolish. There's
nothing more to be said."</p>

<p>Her voice was calm and level. She kept her back
turned to him, distant and unapproachable. He did
not know what to do nor what to say. He had been
a beast to her. He knew it. And because he had
wronged her, because she had made him feel ashamed
of himself, he was angry with her.</p>

<p>"Oh, very well then," he said. "If you won't talk
to me, I'm going home."</p>

<p>He turned and walked out of the room. In the porch
he waited for a moment, thinking that she would call
after him. But no sound came from the drawing-room,
not even the rustle of clothes, that might have indicated
the change of her position. "Oh, well," he said, "if
she's going to sulk, let her sulk," and he walked out of
the house.</p>

<p>For the rest of the day he endured the humiliating
discomfort of contrition. He was honest with himself.
He made no attempt to excuse his behaviour. There
was no excuse for it. He had behaved like a cad.
There was only one thing to do and that was to grovel
as soon as possible. It would be an undignified proceeding,
but he was quite ready to do it, if he could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
certain that the performance would be accepted in the
right spirit. It was not easy to grovel before a person
who turned her back on you, looked out of the window
and refused to listen to what you had to say.</p>

<p>When evening came he decided that he might do
worse than make a reconnaissance of the enemy's
country under the guidance of an armed escort&mdash;in
other words, that if he paid a visit to the Curtises' with
his father he would be able to see April without having
the embarrassment of a private talk forced on him.</p>

<p>And so when Mr Whately returned from the office he
found his son waiting to take him for a walk.</p>

<p>"What a pleasant surprise," he said. "I never
expected to find you here. I thought you would be
spending all your time with April now."</p>

<p>Roland laughed.</p>

<p>"Well, as a matter of fact," he said, "I thought we
might go round and see the Curtises together."</p>

<p>"And you thought you wanted a chaperon?"</p>

<p>"Hardly that."</p>

<p>"But you felt shy of facing the old woman?"</p>

<p>"That's more like it."</p>

<p>"All right, then, we'll tackle her together."</p>

<p>Roland was certain, when they arrived, that the idea
of employing his father as a shield was in the nature of
an inspiration. April received him without a smile;
she did not even shake hands with him. Fortunately,
in the effusion of Mrs Curtis's welcome, this omission
was not noticed.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad you have come, both of you. April
told me, Roland, that you had been round to see her
this morning, and I must say I began to feel afraid that
I should never see you again. I thought you would
only want to come round when you could have April all
to yourself. It would have been such a disappointment
to me if you had; I should have so missed our little
evening talks. As I was saying to my husband only
yesterday, 'I don't know what we should do without
the Whatelys,' and he agreed with me. You know,
Mr Whately, there are some people whom we quite like,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
but whom we shouldn't miss in the least if they went
away and we never saw them again, and there are
others who would leave a real gap. It's funny, isn't
it? And it's so nice, now, to think that Roland and
April&mdash;though we mustn't talk like that, must we, or
they'll begin to think they're engaged. And we couldn't
allow that, could we, Mr Whately?"</p>

<p>His body rattled with a deep chuckle. Out of the
corner of his eye Roland flung a glance at April, to see
what effect this wind of words was having on her, but
her face was turned from him.</p>

<p>Mrs Curtis then proceeded to speak of Arthur and of
the letter she had received from him by the evening
post. "He says&mdash;now what is it that he says? Ah,
yes, here it is; he says, 'As I am too old for the Junior
games, I have been moved into the Senior League.'
Now that's very satisfactory, isn't it, Mr Whately, that
he should be in the Senior League? I always said he
would be good at games, and April too, Mr Whately;
she would have been very good at games if she had
played them. When they used to play cricket in the
nursery she used to hit at the ball so well, with her
arms, you know. She would have been very good, but
she hasn't had the time and they don't go in for games
very much at St Stephen's. Now what do you think of
that new frock of hers? I got it so cheap&mdash;you can't
think how cheaply I got it. And then I got Miss
Smithers to make it up for her, and April looks so
pretty in it; don't you think so, Mr Whately?"</p>

<p>"Charming, of course, Mrs Curtis, absolutely
charming!"</p>

<p>"I thought you'd like it. And I'm sure Roland
does too, though he would be too shy to own to it.
You know, Mr Whately, I felt like telling her when she
put it on that Roland would have to be very careful or
he would find a lot of rivals when he came back from
Brussels."</p>

<p>It was more than April could bear. She had endured
a great deal that day and this was the final ignominy.</p>

<p>"How can you, mother?" she said. "How can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
you?" and jumping to her feet, she ran out of the room,
slamming the door behind her.</p>

<p>The sudden crash reverberated through the awkward
silence; then came the soft caressing voice of Mrs Curtis:
"I'm so sorry, Mr Whately; I don't know what April
can be thinking of. But she's like that sometimes.
These young people are so difficult; one doesn't know
where to find them. Yes, that's right, Roland, run and
see if you can't console her."</p>

<p>For Roland had risen, moved deeply by the sight of
April's misery, her pathetic weakness. It was not fair.
First of all he had been beastly to her, then her mother
had made a fool of her. He found her in the dining-room,
huddled on a chair beside the fire. She turned
at once to him for sympathy. She stretched out her
arms, and he ran towards them, knelt before her and
buried his face in her lap.</p>

<p>"We have been such beasts to you, April, all of us.
I have felt so miserable about it all day. I didn't know
what to do. I thought you would never forgive me. I
don't deserve to be forgiven; but I love you; I do,
really awfully!"</p>

<p>"That's all right," she said; "don't worry," and
placing her hand beneath his chin she raised gently his
face to hers.</p>

<p>It was a long kiss, one of those long passionless kisses
of sympathy, pity and contrition that smooth out all
difficulties, as a wave that passes over a stretch of sand
leaving behind it a shining surface. For a long while
they sat in each other's arms, saying nothing, his
fingers playing with her hair, her lips from moment to
moment meeting his. When at last they reverted to
the subject of their morning's quarrel there was little
possibility of dissension.</p>

<p>It was with a gay smile that she asked him why he
had been so angry with her. "Why shouldn't our
parents know, Roland? They would have had to
some day."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, of course, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And surely, Roland dear," she continued, "it's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
better for us that they should know. I should have
hated having to do things in secret. It would have
been exciting, of course; I know that; but it wouldn't
have been fair to them, would it? They are so fond of
us; they ought to have a share in our happiness."</p>

<p>"That's just what I felt," Roland objected. "I
had felt that our love had ceased to be our own, that
they had taken too big a share of it. It didn't seem to
be our love affair any longer."</p>

<p>"Oh, you silly darling!" and she laughed happily,
relieved of her fear that there might be some deeper
cause for Roland's behaviour to her. "Why should
you worry about that? What does it matter if other
people do know about it? Why, what's an engagement
but a letting of a lot of other people into our
secret; and when we're married, why, that's a telling
of everyone in the whole world that we're in love with
one another. What does it matter if others know?"</p>

<p>"I suppose it doesn't," Roland dubiously admitted.</p>

<p>"Of course it doesn't. The only thing that does
matter," she said, twisting a lock of his hair round her
little finger and smiling at him through half-closed
eyes, "is that we've made up our silly quarrel and are
friends again," and bending forward she kissed him
quietly and happily.</p>

<p>He was naturally relieved that the sympathy between
them had been re-established; but he realised how
little he had made her appreciate his misgivings. Indeed,
he would have found it hard to explain them to
himself. Their love was no longer fresh and spontaneous.
Its growth, as that of a wild flower that is
taken from a hedge and planted in a conservatory,
would be no longer natural. Other hands would tend
it. In April's mind the course of love was marked by
certain fixed boundaries&mdash;the avowal, the engagement,
the marriage service. She did not conceive of love as
existing outside these limits. She had never been in
love before; and naturally she regarded love as a state
of mind into which one was suddenly and miraculously
surprised, and in which one continued until the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
one's life. There was no reason why she should think
differently. Her training had taught her that love
could not exist outside marriage&mdash;marriage that ordained
one woman for one man.</p>

<p>But it was different for Roland, who had learnt from
the vivid and fleeting romances of his boyhood that
love comes and goes, irresponsible as the wind that at
one moment is shaking among the branches, scattering
the leaves, tossing them in the air, only to subside a
moment later into calm.</p>

<p>These misgivings passed quickly enough, however,
in the delightful novelty of the situation. It was
great fun being in love; to wake in the early morning
with the knowledge that as soon as breakfast was over
you would run down the road and be welcomed by a
charming girl, whom you would counsel to shut the
door behind you quickly so that you could kiss her
before anyone knew you were in the house, who
would then tilt up her face prettily to yours. It was
charming to sit with her in the drawing-room and hold
her hand and rest your cheek against hers, to answer
such questions as, "When did you first begin to love
me?"</p>

<p>Often they would go for walks together in the autumn
sunshine; occasionally they would take a bus and ride
out to Kew or Hampstead, and sit on the green grass
and hold hands and talk of the future. These talks
were a delicious excitant to Roland's vanity. His
ambitions were strengthened by her faith in him. He
saw himself rich and famous. "We'll have a wonderful
house, with stables and an orchard, and we'll have
a private cricket ground and we'll get a pro. down from
Lord's to look after it. And we'll have fine parties
in the summer&mdash;cricket and tennis during the day, and
dances in the evening!"</p>

<p>"And a funny little cottage," she would murmur,
"somewhere down the river, for when we want to be
all by ourselves."</p>

<p>It was exciting, too, when other people, grown-up
people, made significant remarks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>One afternoon he was at a tea-party and a lady asked
him if he would come round to lunch with them the
next day. "We've got a nephew of ours stopping
with us. An awfully jolly boy. I'm sure you and he
would get on well together." Roland, however, had to
excuse himself on the grounds of a previous engagement.</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry," he said, "but I've promised to
go on the river."</p>

<p>"With April Curtis? Ah, I thought so."</p>

<p>And the smile that accompanied the question made
Roland feel very grown up and important.</p>

<p>These weeks of preparation for the foreign tour
Roland considered however, in spite of their charm, as
an interlude, a pause in the serious affairs of life. It
was thus that he had always regarded his holidays. He
had divided with a hard line his life at school and his
life at home. The two were unrelated. April and
Ralph, his parents and the Curtises belonged to a world
that must remain for him always episodic. It was a
pleasant world in which from time to time he might
care to sojourn. But what happened to him there was
of no great importance.</p>

<p>As he leant over the taffrail of the steamer and felt
the deck throb under him he knew that his real life had
begun again. What significance had these encumbrances
of his home life if he could cast them off so
easily? Already they were slipping from him. The
waves beat against the side of the ship, splashing the
spray across the deck, and the sting of the water on his
face filled him with a buoyant confidence. The thud
of the engines beat through his body to a tune of
triumph.</p>

<p>The grey line that was England faded and was lost.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a></h3>

<p class="subtitle">THE ROMANCE OF VARNISH</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">A separation</span> of six months makes in the
middle years of a man's life little break in a
relationship. Human life was compared over
two thousand years ago by a Greek philosopher to the
stream that is never the same from one moment to
another. And though, indeed, nothing is permanent,
though everything is in flux, the stream during the later
stages of its passage flows quietly through soft meadows
to the sea. A man of forty-five who has been married
for several years may leave his family to go abroad and
returning at the end of the year find his wife, his home,
his friends, to all appearances, exactly as he left them.</p>

<p>Roland returned from Belgium a different person.
He was no longer a schoolboy; he was a business man.
He had been introduced to big financiers; he had
listened to the discussion of important deals; he had
witnessed the signatures of contracts. In the evenings
he had sat with Marston and gone carefully over the
accounts of the day's transactions.</p>

<p>"There's not much profit here," Marston would say,
"hardly any, in fact, when we've taken over-head
charges, office expenses and all that into consideration.
But we're not out for profits just now. We're building
up connections. If we can make these foreign deals
pay their way we're all right. We shall crowd the
other fellows out of the market, we shall make ourselves
indispensable, and then we can shove our prices as high
as we blooming well like."</p>

<p>To Roland it was a game, with the thrills, the dangers,
the recompenses of a game. He did not look on business
as part of the social fabric. He did not regard wealth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
as a thing important in itself. A credit balance was
like a score at cricket. You were setting your brains
against an opponent's. You made as many pounds as
you could against his bowling. He did not allow first
principles to attach disquieting corollaries. He did
not ask himself whether it was just for a big firm to
undersell their smaller rivals and drive them out of the
market by the simple expedient of taking money out of
one pocket and putting it into another. Business was
a game: if one was big enough to take risks one took
them.</p>

<p>Within a month Gerald was writing home to his
father with genuine enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"He really is first class, father. I thought he would
be pretty useful, but I never expected him to be a
patch on what he is. He's really keen on the job and
he's got the hang of it already. He ought to do jolly
well when he comes out here alone. The big men like
him; old Rosenheim told me the other day that it was
a pleasure to see him about the place. 'Such a relief,'
he said, 'after the dried-up hard-chinned provincials
that pester me from morning to night.' I believe it's
the best thing we ever did, getting Roland into the
business."</p>

<p>Roland, realising that his work was appreciated, grew
confident and hopeful of the future. They were happy
days.</p>

<p>It is not easy to explain the friendship of two men.
And Roland would have been unable to say why exactly
he valued the companionship and esteem of Gerald
Marston more highly than that of the many boys, such
as Ralph Richmond, whom he had known longer and,
on the whole, more intimately. Gerald never said anything
brilliant; he was not particularly amusing; he
was often irritable and moody. But from the moment
when he had seen him for the first time in Brewster's
study Roland had recognised in him a potential friend.
Later, when they had met at the Oval, he had felt that
they understood each other, that they spoke the same
language, that there was between them no need for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
usual preliminaries of friendship. And during their
weeks in France and Belgium this relationship or
intuition was fortified by the sharing of common
interests and common adventures.</p>

<p>The majority of these adventures were, it must be
confessed, of doubtful morality, for it was only
natural that Roland and Gerald should in their spare
time amuse themselves after the fashion of most young
men who find themselves alone in a foreign city.</p>

<p>In the evenings, after they had balanced their accounts,
they used to walk through the warm lighted streets,
surrounded by the stir of a world waking to a night of
pleasure, select a brightly coloured café, sit back on the
red plush couch that ran the length of the room, and
order iced champagne. The band would play soft,
sentimental music that, mixing with the wine in their
heads, would render them eager, daring and responsive,
and when two girls walked slowly down the centre of
the room, swaying from the hips, and casting to left and
right sidelong, alluring glances, naturally they smiled
back, and indicated two vacant seats on either side of
them. Then there would be talk and laughter and
more champagne, and afterwards.... But what
happened afterwards was of small importance. Gerald
had had too much experience to derive much excitement
from bought kisses. And for Roland, these romances
were the focus of little more than a certain lukewarm
kindliness and curiosity. They were not degrading,
because they were not regarded so. They were equally
unromantic, because neither was particularly interested
in the other. Indeed, Roland was a little dismayed to
find how slight, on the whole, was the pleasure, even the
physical pleasure, that he received from his companion's
transports; these experiences, far from having the
devastating effect that they are popularly supposed to
have on a young man's character, would have had in
Roland's life no more significance than an act of solitary
indulgence, had they not been another bond between
himself and Gerald. And this they most certainly were.</p>

<p>It was amusing to meet in the morning afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and exchange confidences. And as everything is transmuted
by the imagination, Roland in a little while came
to look on those evenings&mdash;the wine, the music, the rustle
of skirts, the low laughter&mdash;not as they had been actually,
but as he would have wished to have them. They
became for him a gracious revel. And in London his
thoughts would wander often from his ink-stained desk,
from the screech of the telephone, from the eternal
tapping of the typewriter, to those brightly coloured
cafés, with their atmosphere of warm comfort, the soft
sensuous music, the cool sparkling champagne, the low
whisper at his elbow. When he went out to lunch with
Marston he would frequently contrast the glitter of a
Brussels restaurant with the tawdry furniture and
over-heated atmosphere of a City eating-house.</p>

<p>"A bit different this, isn't it?" he would say. "Do
you remember that evening when we went down the
Rue de la Madeleine and found a café in that little side
street?"</p>

<p>"That was where we met the jolly little girl in the
blue dress, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And do you remember what she said about
the old Padre?"</p>

<p>And they would laugh together over the indelicacies
that had slipped so charmingly in broken English from
those red lips.</p>

<p>But Gerald was the one figure that remained distinct
for Roland. The girls, for the most part, resembled each
other so closely that he could only in rare instances
recall their features or what they had worn or what
they had said. He remembered far more vividly his
walks with Gerald through the lighted streets, their confidences
and hesitations. Should they go into this café
or into that: and then when they had selected their
café how Gerald would open the wine list and carefully
run his finger down the page, while the waiter would
hover over him: "Yes, yes, sir, a very good wine
that, sir, a very good wine indeed!" And then when
the wine was ordered how they would look round at the
girls who sat in couples at the marble-topped tables,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
sipping a citron or a bock. "What do you think of
that couple over there?" "Not bad, but let's wait a
bit; something better may turn up soon"; and a little
later: "Oh, look, that girl over there, the one with the
green dress, just beneath the picture; try and catch her
eye, she looks ripping!" They had been more exciting,
those moments of expectation, than the subsequent
embraces.</p>

<p>Gerald was always the dominant figure.</p>

<p>It was the expression of Gerald's face that Roland
remembered most clearly on that disappointing evening
when they had taken two chorus girls to dinner at a
private room and Roland's selected had refused champagne
and preferred fried sole to pheasant&mdash;an abstinence
so alarming that, in spite of Roland's protests,
Gerald had suddenly decided that they would have to
catch a train to Paris that evening instead of being
able to wait till the morning.</p>

<p>And it was Gerald whom Roland particularly associated
with that ignominious occasion on which he had
thought at last to have discovered real romance.</p>

<p>They had dropped into a restaurant in the afternoon
for a cup of chocolate, and had seen sitting by herself a
girl who could hardly have been twenty years of age.
She wore a wide-brimmed hat, under which Roland
could just see, as she bent her head over her ice, the tip
of her nose, the smooth curve of a cheek, the strain on
the muscles of her neck. She raised the spoon delicately
to her mouth, her lips closed on it and held it there.
Her eyelids appeared to droop in a sort of sensual contentment.
Roland watched her, fascinated: watched
her till she drew the spoon slowly from her mouth.
She lingered pensively, and between the even rows of
her white teeth the red tip of her tongue played for a
moment on the spoon. At that moment she raised her
eyes, observed that Roland was staring at her, smiled,
and dropped her eyes again.</p>

<p>"Did you see that?" whispered Roland excitedly.
"She smiled at me, and she's ripping! I must go and
speak to her!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't be a fool," said Gerald; "a smile may not
mean anything. Besides, she's obviously not a tart and
she may be known here. If she is she won't want to be
seen talking to a stranger. You sit still, like a good boy,
and see if she smiles at you again."</p>

<p>Against his will Roland consented. But he had his
reward a few minutes later when she turned her chair
to catch the waitress's attention, and her eyes, meeting
his, smiled at them again&mdash;a challenging, alluring smile
that seemed to say, "Well, are you brave enough?"
He was dismayed, however, to notice that she had
turned in order to ask for her bill. He saw her run her
eye down the slip of paper, take some money from her
purse and begin to button on her gloves, long gauntlet
gloves that fastened above the elbow.</p>

<p>"She's going! what shall I do?" he asked.</p>

<p>For answer Marston took a piece of paper from his
pocket and wrote on it: "Meet me at the Café des
Colombes to-night at eight-thirty."</p>

<p>"Now, walk up to the counter and pretend to choose
a cake; if she wants to see any more of you she will
drop her handkerchief, or purse, or at any rate give you
an opportunity of speaking to her; if she does, slip
this note into her hand. If she doesn't, you can buy
me an éclair, and thank your lucky stars that you've
been preserved from making a most abandoned fool of
yourself."</p>

<p>Roland was in such a hurry to get to the counter that
he tripped against a table and only saved himself from
falling by gripping violently the shoulder of an elderly
bourgeois. By the time he had completed his apologies
his charmer had very nearly reached the door.</p>

<p>"It's all up," he told himself; "she thinks me a
clumsy fool, that it's not worth her while to worry about,
I ought to have gone straight up to her at once"; and
he followed with dejected eyes her progress towards the
door.</p>

<p>She was carrying in one hand an umbrella and in the
other a little velvet bag. As she raised her hand to
open the door, the bag slipped from her fingers and fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
upon the floor. There were three persons nearer to the
bag than Roland, but before even a hand had been
stretched out to it he had precipitated himself forward,
had picked it up and was handing it to the lady. She
smiled at him with gracious gratitude. So far all had
gone splendidly. Then he began to fumble. The note
was in the other hand, and in the flurry of the moment
he did not know how to manœuvre the bag and the note
into the same hand. First of all, he tried to change
the bag from the right hand to the left. But his forefinger
and thumb were so closely engaged with the note
that the remaining three fingers failed to grasp the
handle of the bag. He made a furious dive and caught
the bag in his right hand just before it reached the floor.
Panic seized him. He lost all sense of the proprieties.
He handed the bag straight to her, and then realising, before
she had had time to take it from him, that somehow
or other the note also had to come into her possession,
he offered it to her between the forefinger and thumb
of his left hand with less secrecy than he would have
displayed in giving a tip to a waiter. The sudden
change of the lady's expression from inviting kindliness
to a surprised affronted indignation threw him into so
acute a fever of embarrassment that once again he
endeavoured to move the bag from the right hand to
the left. Again he fumbled, but with a different result.
He piloted the bag successfully into the lady's hands,
but allowed the note to slip from between his fingers.
It fell face upwards on the floor.</p>

<p>Several ways of escape were open to him. He might
have affected unconcern, and either picked up the piece
of paper or left it where it lay. He might have kicked
the note away and walked forward to open the door.
He might have placed his foot on the note till the
attention of the room was once again directed to its
separate interests. None of these things, however, did
he do. He did what was natural for him in such an
unexpected situation. He did nothing. He stood quite
still and gazed at the note as it lay there startlingly
white against the black tiles of the floor. The eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
of everyone in the room appeared to be directed
towards it. The features of the startled lady assumed
an expression of horrified amazement. Two waitresses
leant over the counter in undisguised excitement;
another stopped dead with a tray in her hand to survey
the incriminating document. The fat gentleman against
whom Roland had collided began to make some unpleasantly
loud remarks to his companion. An old
woman leant forward and asked the room in general
what was happening. From a far corner came the
horrible suppression of a giggle.</p>

<p>The lady herself, who was, as a matter of fact, perfectly
respectable, though she liked to be thought otherwise,
and had dropped her bag accidentally, was the first to
recover her composure. She fixed on Roland a glance
of which as a combination of hatred and contempt he
had never seen the equal, turned quickly and walked
out of the restaurant. The sudden bang of the door
behind her broke the tension. The various spectators
of this entertaining interlude returned to their ices and
their chocolate, the waitresses resumed their duties,
the patron of the establishment fussed up the centre of
the room, and Gerald, who had watched the scene with
intense if slightly nervous amusement, left his table,
picked up the note, and taking Roland by the arm, led
him out of the public notice, and listened to his friend's
solemn vow that never again, under any circumstances,
would he be induced to open negotiations with any
woman, be she never so lovely, who did not by her dress,
her manner and the places she frequented proclaim
unquestionably her profession.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was hardly surprising that as a result of these adventures
a more developed, more independent Roland
returned at the end of his six months' tour, a Roland,
moreover, with a different attitude to himself, his
future, his surroundings, who was prepared to despise the
chrysalis from which he had emerged. His school-days
appeared trivial.</p>

<p>"What a deal of fuss we made about things that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
didn't really matter at all," he said to Gerald as they
leant over the taffrail and watched the dim line that
was England grow distinct, its grey slowly whitening as
they drew near. "What a fuss about one's place in
form, one's position in the house; whether one ragged
or whether one didn't rag. I can see all those masters,
with their solemn faces, thinking I had perjured my
immortal soul because I had walked out with a girl.
They really thought it mattered."</p>

<p>How puny it became in comparison with this magnificent
gamble of finance! What were marks in an
exam. to set against a turnover of several thousands?
Duty, privilege, responsibility; what had they been
but the brightly coloured bricks with which children
play in the nursery; and as for the fret and fever concerning
their arrangement, where could be found an
equivalent for the serious absorption of a child?</p>

<p>In the same way he thought of his home and the
environment of his boyhood. What a grey world it had
been! How monotonous, how arid! He remembered
sitting as a child at the bars of his nursery window
watching the stream of business men hurrying to their
offices in the morning, their newspapers tucked under
their arms. They had seemed to him like marionettes.
The front door had opened. Husband and wife had
exchanged a brusque embrace; the male marionette
had trotted down the steps, had paused at the gate to
wave his hand, and as he had turned into the street the
front door had closed behind him. Always the same
thing every day. And then in the evening the same
stream of tired listless men hurrying home, their bulky
morning paper exchanged for the slim evening newssheet.
They would trot up the white stone steps, the front door
would swing open, again in the porch the marionettes
would kiss. It had amused him as a child, this dumb
show, but as a boy he had come to hate it&mdash;and to fear
it also. For he knew that this was the life that awaited
him if he failed to turn to account his superior opportunities.
The fear of degenerating into a suburban
business man had been always the strongest goad to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
ambition. But now he could look that fear confidently
in the face. He had won through out of that world of
routine and friction and small economies into one of
enterprise and daring and romance.</p>

<p>And April: he had not thought very much about
her during his six months' absence; she belonged to
the world he had outgrown, a landmark on his road
of adventure. And it was disconcerting to find on his
return that she did not regard their relationship in this
light. Roland had grown accustomed to the fleeting
relationships of school that at the start of a new term
could be resumed or dropped at will. He had not
realised that it would be different now; that six
months in Belgium were not the equivalent of a seven
weeks' summer holiday; that he would be returning to
an unaltered society in which he would be expected to
fulfil the obligations incurred by him before his departure.
It was the reversal of the Rip Van Winkle
legend. Roland had altered and was returning to a
world that was precisely as he had left it.</p>

<p>Nothing had changed.</p>

<p>On the first evening he went round to visit April, and
there was Mrs Curtis as she had always been, sitting
before the fire, her hands crossed over her bony bosom.
She welcomed him as though he had been spending a
week-end in Kent.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad to see you, Roland, and have you had a
nice time? It must be pleasant for you to think of how
soon the cricket season will be starting. I was saying
to our little April only yesterday: 'How Roland will
be looking forward to it.' What club are you thinking
of joining?"</p>

<p>"The Marstons said something to me about my
joining their local club."</p>

<p>"But how jolly that would be! You'll like that,
won't you?"</p>

<p>Her voice rose and fell as it had risen and fallen as
long as Roland's memory had knowledge of her. The
same clock ticked over the same mantelpiece; above
the table was the same picture of a cow grazing beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
a stream; the curtains, once red, had not faded to a
deeper brown; the carpet was no more threadbare;
the same books lined the shelves that rose on either side
of the fire-place; in the bracket beside the window was
the calf-bound set of <cite>William Morris</cite> that had been
presented to April as a prize; on the rosewood table
lay yesterday's copy of <cite>The Times</cite>. Mrs Curtis and her
setting were eternal in the scheme of things.</p>

<p>April, too, was as he had left her. Indeed, her life in
his absence had been a pause. She had no personal
existence outside Roland. She had waited for his
return, thinking happily of the future. She had gone
to school every morning at a quarter to nine and had
returned every evening at half-past five. During the
Christmas holidays she had read <cite>Nicholas Nickleby</cite> and
<cite>Vanity Fair</cite>. She was now half-way through <cite>Little
Dorrit</cite>. At the end of the Michaelmas term she had
gained a promotion into a higher form and in her new
form she had acquitted herself creditably, finishing
half-way up the class. At home she had performed
cheerfully the various duties that had been allotted to
her. But she had regarded those six months as an
interlude in her real life: that was Roland's now.
Happiness could only come to her through him; and,
being sure of happiness, she was not fretful nor impatient
during the delay. She did not expect nor
indeed ask of life violent transports either of ecstasy
or sorrow. Her ideas of romance were domestic
enough. To love and to be loved faithfully, to have
children, to keep a home happy, a home to which her
friends would be glad to come&mdash;this seemed to her as
much as any woman had the right to need. She felt
that she would be able to make Roland happy. The
prospect was full of a quiet but deep contentment.</p>

<p>Roland had no opportunity of speaking to her on
that first evening; Mrs Curtis, as usual, monopolised
the conversation. But he sat near to April. From
time to time their eyes met and she smiled at him. And
the next morning when he came round to see her she
ran eagerly to meet him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's lovely to have you back again," she said; "you
can't think how I've been looking forward to it!"</p>

<p>Roland was embarrassed by her eagerness. He did
not know what to say and stood beside her, smiling
stupidly.</p>

<p>She pouted.</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to kiss me?" she said. And a
moment later: "I shouldn't have thought, after six
months, you'd have needed asking!"</p>

<p>Roland met her reproach with a stammered apology.</p>

<p>"I felt shy. I thought you might have got tired of
me, all that long time."</p>

<p>"Oh, but Roland, how horrid of you!" And she
moved away from him. But he took her in his arms and
made love prettily to her and consoled her.</p>

<p>"I daresay," she said, "I daresay. But you didn't
write to me so very often."</p>

<p>"I wanted to, but I thought your mother wouldn't
like it."</p>

<p>"Oh, but, Roland, that's no excuse; she expected
you to. There's an understanding." Then with a quiet
smile: "Do you remember the row we had about that
understanding?"</p>

<p>"I was a beast."</p>

<p>"No, you weren't, I was a silly."</p>

<p>"I was miserable about it."</p>

<p>"So was I. I didn't know what to do with myself.
I thought you'ld never speak to me again, that you'd
gone off in a huff, like the heroes in the story books."</p>

<p>"But the heroes always come back in the story books."</p>

<p>"I know, and that's just why I thought that very
likely you wouldn't in real life. I was so unhappy I
cried myself to sleep."</p>

<p>"We were sillies, weren't we?"</p>

<p>"But it was worth it," said April.</p>

<p>"Worth it?"</p>

<p>"Don't you remember how nice you were to me
when we made it up?"</p>

<p>They laughed and kissed, and the minutes passed
pleasantly. But their love-making fell short of Roland's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
ideal of love. It was jolly; it was comfortable; but
it was little more. He was not thrilled when the back
of his hand brushed accidentally against hers; their
kisses were hardly a lyric ecstasy. Even when he held
her in his arms he was conscious of himself, outside
their embrace, watching it, saying to himself: "Those
two are having a good time together," and being outside
it he was envious, jealous of a happiness he did not share.
It was someone else who was holding April's hand,
someone else's head that bent to her slim shoulder.
It was an exciting experience. But then had it not
been exciting to walk across Hampstead Heath on a
Sunday evening and observe the feverish ardours of
the prostrate lovers.</p>

<p>He despised himself; he reminded himself that he
was extraordinarily lucky to have a girl such as April
in love with him; he was unworthy of her. Was not
Ralph eating out his heart with envy? And yet he
was dissatisfied. The Curtises' house had become a
prison for him; a soft, warm prison, with cushions and
shaded lights and gentle voices, but it was a prison
none the less. He was still able to leave it at will, but
the time was coming when that freedom would be
denied him. In a year or two their understanding
would be an engagement; the engagement would drift
to marriage. For the rest of his life he would be
enclosed in that warm, clammy atmosphere. There
was a conspiracy at work against him. His father had
already begun to speak of his marriage as an accomplished
fact. His mother was chiefly glad he was doing
well in business because success there would make an
early marriage possible. On all sides inducements were
being offered him to marry&mdash;marriage with its corollary
to settle down. Marry and settle down, when
he was still under twenty!&mdash;before he had begun to live!</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a></h3>

<p class="subtitle">MARSTON &amp; MARSTON</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">During</span> the weeks that immediately followed
his return, Roland found that he was, on the
whole, happiest when he was at the office. He
had less there to worry him. His work was new and
interesting. Mr Marston had decided that before
Roland went on his tour alone he should acquire a
general knowledge of the organisation of the business.
And so Roland spent a couple of weeks in each
department, acquainting himself with the routine.</p>

<p>"And a pretty good slack it will be," Gerald had
said. "It's the governor's pet plan. He made me do
it. But you won't learn anything that's going to be of
the least use to you. All you've got to do in this show
is to be polite and impress opulent foreigners. You
don't need to know the ingredients of varnish nor how
we arrange our advertising accounts. And you can
bet that the fellows themselves won't be in any hurry
to teach you. The less we know about things the
better they're pleased. They like to run their own
show. If I were you I should have as lazy a time as
possible."</p>

<p>Under ordinary circumstances Roland would have
followed this advice. He had learnt at Fernhurst to
do as much work as was strictly necessary, but no more.
He had prepared his lessons carefully for his house
tutor and the games' master, the two persons, that is to
say, who had it in their power to make his existence
there either comfortable or the reverse. He had also
worked hard for the few masters, such as Carus Evans,
who disliked him. That was part of his armour.
When Carus Evans had said to him for the third day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
running, "Now, I think we'll have you, Whately,"
and he had translated the passage without a slip, he
felt that he was one up on Carus Evans. But for the
others, the majority with whom he was only brought
into casual contact, and who were pleasantly indifferent
to those who caused them no trouble, he did only as
much work as was needful to keep him from the detention-room.
Roland had rarely been inconvenienced by
uncomfortable scruples about duty.</p>

<p>At any other time he would have spent the days of
apprenticeship in placid idleness&mdash;discussion of cricket
matches; visits to the window and subsequent
speculation on the prospects of fine weather over the
week-end; glances at his watch to see how soon he
could slip from the cool of the counting house into the
hot sunshine that was beating upon the streets; pleasant
absorption in a novel. But Roland was worried
by the family situation; he was finding life dull; he
was prepared to abandon himself eagerly to any fresh
enthusiasm. For want of anything better to do, without
premeditation, with no thought of the power that
this knowledge might one day bring him, he decided to
understand the business of Marston &amp; Marston.</p>

<p>On the first morning he was handed over to the care
of Mr Stevens, the head of the trade department. Mr
Stevens was a faithful servant of the firm, and, as is
the way with faithful servants, considered himself to be
more important than his employers.</p>

<p>"They may sit up in that board-room of theirs," he
would say, "and they may pass their resolutions, and
they may decide on this and they may decide on that,
but where'ld they be without their figures, I'd like to
know. And who gives them their figures?"</p>

<p>He would chuckle and scratch his bald head, and issue
a fierce series of orders to the packers. He bore no
malice against his directors; he was not jealous; he
knew that there were two classes, the governing and the
governed, and that it had been his fate to be born
among the governed.</p>

<p>"There always have been two classes and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
always will be two classes. We can't all be bosses."
It was a law of nature. And he considered his
performances more creditable than those of his masters.</p>

<p>"These directors," he would say, "they were born
into the business. They've stayed where they was
put; they haven't gone up and they haven't gone down.
But I&mdash;I started as a packer and I'm now head of the
trade department; and look you here, Jones," he would
suddenly bellow out, "if you hammer nails into a box
at that rate you'll not only not be head of a trade
department, you'll blooming soon cease to be a packer!"</p>

<p>It was natural that Mr Stevens should, from his
previous experience of Gerald and certain other young
gentlemen, regard Roland as an agreeable trifler on the
fringe of important matters.</p>

<p>"Well, well, sir, so you've come along to see how we
do things down here. I expect we shall be able to show
you a thing or two. Now, if you was to go and sit over
in that corner you'd be out of the way and you'd be
able to see the business going on."</p>

<p>"I daresay, Mr Stevens, but that won't help me very
far, will it?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't say that, sir; nothing like seeing how the
machinery works."</p>

<p>"But I might as well go and ask an engine-driver
how a train worked and then be told to sit in a corner
of the platform at a railway station and watch the
trains go by. I should see how they worked but I
shouldn't know much about them."</p>

<p>Mr Stevens chuckled and scratched the bald patch
on his head appreciatively.</p>

<p>"You see, Mr Stevens," Roland continued, "I don't
know anything about this show at all and I know that
you're the only person in the place who can help me."</p>

<p>It was a lucky shot. Roland was not then the
psychologist that he was to become in the days of his
power. He worked by intuition. What he had intended
for a graceful compliment was a direct appeal
to Mr Stevens' vanity, at the point where it was most
susceptible to such an assault. It was a grief at times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
to Mr Stevens that the authorities should regard him
as little more than a useful servant, who carried out
efficiently the orders that they gave him. Mr Stevens
was not ambitious; the firm had treated him fairly,
had recognised his talents early and had promoted him.
He had no quarrel with the firm, but he knew&mdash;what no
one else in the building, with the possible exception of
Perkins, the general manager, did know&mdash;that for a long
time he had ceased to carry out to the letter the instructions
that had been given him, and that Mr Marston
had only a general knowledge of a department that he
himself knew intimately. He had arranged numerous
small improvements of which Mr Marston was ignorant,
and had exploited highly profitable exchanges of material
with other dealers. Mr Marston may have perhaps
noticed in the general accounts a gradual fall in packing
expenses, but if he had he had attributed it, without
much thought, to the increased facilities for obtaining
wood and cardboard. He did not know that as the
result of most delicate manœuvring and an intricate
system of exchange conducted by Mr Stevens his firm
was being supplied with cardboard at the actual cost
price.</p>

<p>Mr Stevens did not tell him. He enjoyed his little
secret. Every year he would consult the figures,
scratch his bald head and chuckle. What a lot he had
saved the firm! He looked forward to the day when he
should tell Mr Marston. How surprised they would all
be! They had never suspected that funny old Stevens
was such a good business man. In the evening hours
of reverie and after lunch on Sunday he would endow
the scene with that dramatic intensity that he had
looked for but had not yet found in life. There were
other moments, however, when he longed for appreciation.
He wished that someone would realise his importance
without having to have it explained to him. So
that when Roland said to him, "You're the only person
in the place who can help me," he was startled into
the indulgence of his one weakness.</p>

<p>"Well, well, sir," he said, and his face flushed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
pleasure, "I daresay if you put it like that"; and taking
Roland by the arm he led him away into his study and
began to explain his accounts, his invoices, his receipts
and his method of checking them. And because he had
found an appreciative audience he proceeded to reveal
one by one his little secrets. "Mr Marston doesn't
know I do this, and don't tell him, I'm keeping it as a
surprise; but you can see that by letting the wood
merchants have that extra percentage there, I can get
tin-foil cheap enough to be able to pack our stuff at
two per cent. less than it would cost ordinarily. Think
what I must have saved the firm!"</p>

<p>There could be no question of his value; but what
Roland did not then appreciate&mdash;what, for that matter,
Mr Stevens himself did not appreciate&mdash;was the value of
this work in relation to the general business of the firm.
Mr Stevens was a specialist. He understood his own
department but he understood nothing else. He did
not realise that on the delicate balance of that two per
cent, it had been possible to undersell a dangerous rival.</p>

<p>The same conditions, Roland discovered, existed in
several other departments. Each head worked independently
of the other heads. Mr Marston, sitting at
his desk, co-ordinated their work. A one-man business:
that was Mr Marston's programme. One brain must control,
otherwise there would be chaos. One department
would find itself working against another department.
He believed in departments because they stood
for the delegation of routine work, but they must be
subordinate departments. There were moments, however,
when Roland wondered whether Mr Marston's
hold on the business had not relaxed with the years. A
great deal was going on of which he was ignorant. He
had started the machinery and the machinery still ran
smoothly, but was the guiding hand ready to deal with
stoppages? Roland wondered. How much did Mr
Marston really know? Had he kept up with modern
ideas, or was he still living with the ideas that were
current in his youth? But more than this even,
Roland wondered how much Perkins knew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>He did not like Perkins. "A good man," Mr
Marston had called him, "as good a general manager
as you're likely to find anywhere. Not a social beauty;
silent, and all that, but a good strong man. You can
trust him."</p>

<p>Roland did not agree with this estimate. First
impressions are very often right; he was inclined to
trust his intuition before his reason, and his first impression
of Perkins was of an embittered, jealous man.
"He hates me," Roland thought, "because I'm stepping
straight into this business through influence, with every
prospect of becoming a director before I've finished;
while he's sweated all his life, and worked from nothing
to a position that for all his ability will never carry him
to the board-room." He was a man to watch. The
people who have been mishandled by fortune show no
mercy when they get the chance of revenge.</p>

<p>Perkins was scrupulously polite, but Roland felt how
much he resented his intrusion, and Gerald was inclined
to endorse this opinion.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, a sour-faced ass," he said; "father thinks
a lot of him, though. It's as well to keep on the right
side of him. He can make things rather awkward if
you don't. He keeps an eye on most of the accounts,
and he watches the travellers' expenses pretty closely.
If he gets annoyed with you he might start questioning
your extras."</p>

<p>They laughed, remembering how they had entered
under the heading "special expenses" the charges for a
lurid evening at a certain discreet establishment in the
Rue des Colombes.</p>

<p>On the whole, Roland was happy at the office, but
the evenings were distressing: the bus ride back; the
walk up the hot stuffy street towards his home; the
subsequent walk with his father; the same walk every
day along the hard, flag-stoned roads, during which
they met the same dispirited men hurrying home from
work. London was horrible in June, with its metallic
heat, its dust, and the dull leaves of the plane-trees
scattering their mournful shadows. How sombre, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
were the long evenings after the wretched two-course
dinner, in the small suburban drawing-room&mdash;ill lit, ill
ventilated, meanly furnished. It was not surprising
that he should accept eagerly the Marstons' frequent
invitations to spend the week-end with them in the
country; it was another world, a cleaner, fresher world,
where you were met at the station, where you drove
through a long, winding drive to an old Georgian house,
where you dressed for dinner, where you drank crusted
port as you cracked your walnuts. Yet it was not this
material well-being that he so highly valued as the
setting it provided for a gracious interchange of courtesy,
for the leisured preliminaries of friendship, for
ornament and decoration.</p>

<p>Was anything in his life better than that moment on
a Friday evening when from the corner seat of a railway
carriage he watched the smoke and chimneys of London
fall behind him, when through the window he saw,
instead of streets and shops and houses, green fields and
hedges and small scattered villages, and knew that for
forty-eight hours he could forget the fretted uneasiness
of his home.</p>

<p>He was invited during August to spend a whole week
at Hogstead. Several others would be there, and there
would be cricket every day.</p>

<p>"We can't do without you," Mr Marston had said,
"and what's more, we don't intend to."</p>

<p>"Of course, we don't," said Muriel; "you've got to
come!"</p>

<p>Naturally Roland did not need much pressing.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a></h3>

<p class="subtitle">LILITH OF OLD</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Roland</span> made during this week the acquaintance
of several members of the family who had
hitherto been only names to him. There was
Gerald's uncle Arnold, a long mean-faced man, and his
wife, Beatrice. Afterwards, when he looked back and
considered how large a part she had played, if indirectly,
in his life, and for that matter in the lives of all of them,
he could not help thinking that his first sight of her
had been prophetic, certainly dramatic. He had just
arrived, had been met by Muriel and Mr Marston and
his brother in the hall, and Muriel had insisted on taking
him away at once to see her rabbits. She had come to
regard him as her special friend. Gerald's other friends
were too stiff and grown up; Roland was nearer to her
own age and he did not patronise her.</p>

<p>"Come along," she said, "you've got to see my
rabbits before dinner-time."</p>

<p>"Will they have grown up by to-morrow?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Well, they won't be any younger, will they? They
are such dears," and she had taken his hand, pulling
him after her. They ran down the curving path that
sloped from the house to the cricket field. "I keep
them in that little shed behind the pavilion," she said.
They were certainly delightful, little brown and white
balls of fur, with stupid, blinking eyes. Roland and
Muriel took them out of the cage and carried them on
to the terrace that ran round the field, and sat there
playing with them, offering them grass and dandelions.</p>

<p>A grass path ran between great banks of rhododendrons
from the terrace towards the garden, and at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
end a pergola stretched a red riot of roses parallel to
the field. Suddenly at the end of the path, at the point
where it met the pergola, Roland saw, framed in an
arch of roses, a tall, graceful woman walking slowly on
Gerald's arm, her head bent quietly towards him. At
that distance Roland could not distinguish her features,
but the small oval face set in the mass of light yellow
hair was delicate and the firm outlines of her body
suggested that she had only recently left her girlhood
behind her.</p>

<p>"Who's that?" asked Roland.</p>

<p>"That! Oh, that's Aunt Beatrice."</p>

<p>"But who's Aunt Beatrice?"</p>

<p>"Uncle Arnold's wife."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>Roland could hardly believe it: so young a woman
married to that shrivelled, prosaic solicitor.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Muriel, "they've been married nearly
three years now; and they've got such a darling little
girl: Rosemary; you'll see her to-morrow. She's got
the loveliest hair. It crinkles when you run your
fingers through it."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;oh, well, I suppose it's rather cheek, but he's
years older."</p>

<p>"Uncle Arnold?" replied Muriel cheerfully. "Oh,
yes, I think he must be nearly fifty." Then after a
pause, light-heartedly as though the possession of a
family skeleton was something of an honour, "I don't
think they like each other much."</p>

<p>"How do you know?" Roland asked.</p>

<p>"They are always quarrelling. I never saw such a
couple for it. If there's a discussion he's only got to
take one side for her to take the other."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't see very well how she could be in love
with him, he's such a...." Roland paused, realising
that it would be hardly good manners to disparage
Muriel's uncle. But she did not intend him to leave
the sentence unfinished.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "such a.... Go on!"</p>

<p>"But I didn't mean that."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, you did."</p>

<p>"No, I didn't; really I didn't. I'm sure your uncle's
awfully nice, but he's so much older, and you can't be
in love with someone so much older than yourself."</p>

<p>"I see; you're forgiven"; then after a pause and
with a mischievous smile: "Have you ever been in love,
Roland?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Oh, how lovely!" and she turned quickly and sat
facing him, her knees drawn up, her hands clasped in
front of them. "Now tell me all about it. I've
always wanted to have a talk with someone who's
really been in love, and I never have."</p>

<p>"What about Gerald?"</p>

<p>She pouted. "Gerald! Oh, well, but he laughs at me,
and besides&mdash;&mdash;But come on and tell me all about it."</p>

<p>She made a pretty picture as she sat there, her face
alight with the eagerness of curious girlhood, and
Roland felt to the full the fascination of such a confessional.
"It was a long time ago," he said, "and
it's all over now."</p>

<p>"Never mind that," Muriel persisted. "What was
her name?"</p>

<p>"Betty."</p>

<p>"And was she pretty?"</p>

<p>"Of course; I shouldn't have been in love with her
if she hadn't been."</p>

<p>Muriel tossed back her head and laughed. "Oh,
but how absurd, Roland! Some of the ugliest women
I've ever seen have managed to get husbands."</p>

<p>"And some pretty hideous-looking men get pretty
wives."</p>

<p>"But I suppose the pretty wives think their ugly
husbands are all right."</p>

<p>"And equally I suppose the handsome husbands
think their plain wives beautiful."</p>

<p>They laughed together, but Muriel raised a warning
finger. "We are getting off the point," she said. "I
want to know more about your Betty. Was she dark?"</p>

<p>"Darkish&mdash;yes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>"And her eyes; were they dark too?"</p>

<p>"I think so; they were bright."</p>

<p>"What, aren't you sure? I don't think much of
you as a lover."</p>

<p>"But I can never remember the colour of people's
eyes," he pleaded. "I can't remember the colour of
my mother's or my aunt's, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Quick, shut your eyes; what's the colour of my
eyes?"</p>

<p>"Blue," Roland hazarded.</p>

<p>"Wrong. They're green. Cat's eyes. You ought
to be ashamed of yourself. I shall write and tell your
Betty about it."</p>

<p>"But that's all over long ago, I told you."</p>

<p>"How did it end?"</p>

<p>"It never began," laughed Roland: "she never cared
for me a bit."</p>

<p>Muriel pouted. "How unromantic," she said; then
added with the quick, mischievous smile, "and how
silly of her!"</p>

<p>As he dressed for dinner that evening Roland
wondered what perverse impulse had made him speak
to Muriel of Betty rather than of Dolly; of either of
them rather than of April; of an unsuccessful love affair
that was over rather than of a successful one that was in
progress. Muriel would far rather have heard of April
than of Betty. How she would have pestered him with
questions! Where had they met? When had he first
known he was in love with her? What had he said to
her? How had she answered him? It would have
been great fun to confide in her. He had been foolish
not to tell her. She was such a jolly girl. She had
looked charming as she had sat back holding her knees,
with her clear skin and slim boyish figure, and her
brightly tinted lips that were always a little parted
before her teeth, beautifully even teeth they were,
except just at the corner of her mouth where one white
tooth slightly overlapped its neighbour. She was the
sort of girl that he would like to have had for a sister.
He had always regretted that he had not had one, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
between Muriel and himself there could have been
genuine, open comradeship. She would have been a
delightful companion. They would have had such fun
going about together to parties, dances and the Oval.
She would have received so charmingly his confidence.</p>

<p>And yet, on the whole, he did not know why, he was
rather glad that he had not told her about April.</p>

<p>That night Roland sat next Beatrice at dinner, and
was thus afforded an opportunity of confirming or rejecting
his first impression of her. She was only twenty
years old, but she looked younger, not so much on account
of her slim figure and small, delicate, oval face as
of her general pose and the girlish untidiness that made
you think that she had not taken very long over her
toilet. Her light yellow hair was drawn back carelessly
from the smooth skin of her neck and forehead. It
looked as though it had been crushed all the afternoon
under a tightly fitting hat, and that when Beatrice
had returned from her walk, probably a little late, she
had flung the hat on the bed, and deciding that she
could not be bothered to take down her hair and put it
up again had been content to draw her comb through
it once or twice with hurried, impatient fingers. This
negligence, which might have been charming as the
setting for mobile, vivacious features, was out of keeping
with the tranquillity of her face, her quiet gestures
and lack of action. She had not learnt how to dress and
carry herself, and this was an omission you would hardly
expect in a woman who had been married for three
years.</p>

<p>And yet she was beautiful, or perhaps not so much
beautiful as different. She suggested tragedy, mystery,
romance. What, Roland asked himself, lay behind
the wavering lustre of her eyes? And, looking at
the meagre, uninspired features of her husband, he
wondered how she could have ever brought herself to
marry him. He was a very good fellow, no doubt, of
whom one might grow fond&mdash;but love&mdash;to be held in his
arms, to be kissed by those dry lips! He shuddered,
revolted by this dismal mating of spring and autumn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>She did not talk very much, though occasionally,
when her husband made a particularly definite statement,
she would raise her head and say rather
contemptuously: "Oh, Arnold!" to which he would
reply with heavy worded argument: "My dear girl,
what you don't understand is...." It was uncomfortable,
and Roland, looking round the table, wondered
whether the family was aware of it. They did not appear
to be. At one end of the table Mr Marston was discussing,
in his jovial, full-blooded manner, the prospects
of the cricket week, and, at the other, Mrs Marston
was informing a member of the Harrow XI. that their
opponents of the morrow had recruited a couple of
blues from a neighbouring village. Gerald and Muriel
were both laughing and chatting, and the other members
of the party seemed equally not to notice the close
atmosphere of impending conflict. Perhaps they had
grown accustomed to it.</p>

<p>Roland listened carefully to all that Arnold Marston
said, both during dinner and afterwards when the ladies
had gone upstairs and the port had been passed for
the second time round the table. He was hard,
dogmatic and, at the same time, petulant in his talk.
He quickly assumed that everyone who did not agree
with him was ignorant and a fool. As he talked his
fingers performed small gestures of annoyance; they
plucked at the table-cloth, fingered the water-bowl,
heaped the salt into small pyramids upon his plate.
They were discussing the pull shot, then something of
an innovation, and Roland maintained that it was
absurd for school coaches not to allow boys to hit across
long hops. "Why, do you know that at Fernhurst
you are expected to apologise to the bowler if you make
a pull shot."</p>

<p>"And quite right, too," said Mr Arnold.</p>

<p>"But, why?" Roland answered him. "The pull's
perfectly safe; it's a four every time and you can't get
more than a single if you play back to it with a straight
bat."</p>

<p>"I daresay, I daresay, but cricket's cricket, and you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
have got to play it with a straight bat. You've got to
play according to rules."</p>

<p>"But there's no rule that says you mayn't hit a long
hop with a crooked bat."</p>

<p>Mr Arnold fidgeted angrily.</p>

<p>"My dear boy, it's no good arguing. I've been
playing cricket and watching cricket for forty years,
and the good batsmen always played a straight ball
with a straight bat."</p>

<p>"There are a good many who don't."</p>

<p>"That means nothing. A big man's a rule to
himself. The pull's a dangerous stroke; it's all right
in village cricket perhaps, but no one who doesn't play
with a straight bat would get into a county side."</p>

<p>"But isn't it the object of the game to make runs?"</p>

<p>"Not altogether&mdash;even if you do get four runs from
it instead of one, which I am prepared to doubt. We
wear our clothes to keep our bodies warm, but you
wouldn't be pleased if your tailor made your coat
button up to the throat, and said: 'It covers more of
you, sir; you'll be warmer that way, and the object of
clothes is to keep you warm.'"</p>

<p>There was a general laugh at Roland's expense,
and before it had subsided Mr Marston had introduced
another subject. Roland was annoyed; he had a
distaste for anything that savoured of cleverness. He
regarded it as an unfair weapon in an argument. An
argument should be a weighing of facts. Each side
should produce its facts, and an impartial witness
should give judgment. It was not fair to obscure the
issue with an untrue, if amusing, simile. And once the
laugh is against you it is no good continuing an argument.
Arnold Marston had learnt this on his election
platform. He had once been asked what his party
proposed to do for the unemployed; it was an awkward
question, that gave many opportunities for adverse
heckling. But he had obscured the issue with a laugh:
"When my party gets in there will be no unemployment."
And the meeting had gone home with the
opinion that he was a jolly fellow&mdash;not too serious&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
sort of man that anyone could understand. It was a
good trick on the platform, but it was very annoying
at the dinner-table, at least so the discomfited found.
And Roland felt even more aggrieved as they were
leaving the room and the silly ass in the Harrow XI.
slapped him on the back and informed him that, "The
old man got in a good one on you there." He could
understand Beatrice hating him.</p>

<p>He did not have another opportunity of speaking to
her that evening, but as he sat in the big drawing-room
among the members of the house party his attention
drifted continually from the agreeable, superficial
conversation that had been up to now so sympathetic
to him. These trivial discussions of cricket, their
friends, their careers, and, in a desultory manner, of
life itself, had been invaded by a stern, critical silence.
His eyes kept turning towards Beatrice as she sat in a
deep arm-chair, her hands folded quietly in her lap;
they followed her when she walked to the window and
stood there, her arm raised above her head, looking into
the garden. He would have liked to go across the room
and speak to her; but what would he have been able
to say? He could not tell what thoughts were passing
beneath the unruffled surface: was she fretting impatiently
at the tedious cricket shop? Was she
criticising them all?&mdash;she, who had seen deeper and
farther and come nearer to tragedy than any of them&mdash;or
was she what she appeared&mdash;a young woman moved
by the poetry of a garden stilled by moonshine? When
she turned away he thought that he detected a movement
of her shoulders, a gesture prompted by some
wandering thought or gust of feeling, that would have
been significant to one who knew her, but for him was
meaningless. And that night he lay awake for nearly
an hour, a long time for one who thought little and to
whom sleep came easily, remembering her words and
actions, the intonation of her voice, and that movement
by the window. As he began to lose control over
thoughts she became transfigured, the counterpart of
those princesses, shut away in high-walled castles, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
whom he had dreamed in childhood; her husband
became an ogre, leering and vindictive, who laughed at
him from the turrets of impregnable battlements.</p>

<p>Breakfast at Hogstead was a haphazard business. It
began at eight and ended at ten. No one presided over
it. There were cold things on the sideboard to which
you helped yourself. As soon as you came down you
rang the bell and a maid appeared to ask you whether
you would prefer tea or coffee and whether you would
take porridge. You then sat down where you liked at
the long wide table.</p>

<p>When Roland came down the next morning at about
a quarter to nine he found the big rush on; from half-past
eight to half-past nine there were usually six or
seven people at the table. Before that time there was
only Mrs Marston and anyone who had been energetic
enough to take a dip in a very cold pond that was protected
from sunshine by the northern terrace of the
cricket field. By a quarter to ten there was usually
only a long table, covered with dirty plates, to keep
company with Mr Marston, who, strangely enough, was
a late riser. There were eight people in all having
breakfast when Roland arrived, or, to be more exact,
there were seven, for Gerald had finished his some
time before, but as he had had a bathe he preferred to
remain at the table and inform everyone of his courage
as they came down.</p>

<p>"I can't think why everyone doesn't bathe in the
morning," he was saying; "makes one feel splendidly
fit. I'm absolutely glowing all over."</p>

<p>"So you've told us before," said Muriel.</p>

<p>"I've told you, but I haven't told Roland. Roland,
why didn't you come and have a bathe this morning,
you old slacker? Do you no end of good."</p>

<p>"Puts one's eye out," said Roland, repeating the
old Fernhurst theory that cricket and swimming are
incompatible.</p>

<p>"Rot, my dear chap; nothing like a bathe, nothing
like it. I bet you I shall skittle them out this afternoon,
and I don't see why I shouldn't make a few runs either."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>Roland had by this time satisfied the maid's curiosity
as to his beverage and had helped himself to a plate of
tongue and ham. He turned round with the plate in
his hand and looked to see where he should sit.
There was a vacant place beside Gerald to which
he would have been expected to direct himself; there
was also a vacant place beside Beatrice: he chose
the latter, and hardly realised till he had drawn back
the chair that Gerald was at the opposite end of the
table.</p>

<p>Several thoughts passed with incredible swiftness
through his brain. Had anyone noticed what he had
done? Would they think it curious? More important
still, would Beatrice resent it? From this last
anxiety he was soon freed, for Beatrice, without
apparently having observed his presence, rose from
the table and went into the garden. He was left with
an empty chair on either side of him and no one for him
to talk to; Gerald and Muriel were beyond the reach
of anything less than a shout.</p>

<p>He finished his breakfast hurriedly in an enforced
silence and walked out into the garden in the secret
hope of finding Beatrice. In this he soon succeeded.
She was playing croquet with her daughter on the
lawn. Roland stood watching them for a moment and
then walked slowly across the lawn. Beatrice glanced
up at him and then went on with her game. She did
not even smile at him. It would have been too much
perhaps to have expected her to ask him to join them,
but she might surely have made some sign of comradely
recognition. After all, he had the night before taken her
down to dinner; he had endeavoured to be as nice as
he could to her, and it annoyed him and, at the same
time, attracted him to feel that he had made absolutely
no impression on her.</p>

<p>Roland was not one of those who analyse their
emotions. When he was attracted by some new
interest he did not put himself in the confessional, and
he did not now ask himself why or how Beatrice had
appealed to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>As a matter of fact, she did not attract him physically.
Her beauty added to the glamour that enriched
her loneliness, but did not touch him otherwise. It
was interest he felt for her, a compelling interest for
someone outside the circle of his own experience, who
was content to disparage what he admired and had
filled her own life with other enthusiasms. She was
remote, inscrutable. She lived and ate and talked and
moved among them, but she had no part there. And
because he was so interested in her he was desperately
anxious that she should feel some interest in him. She
was a mystery for him, but he was not content she
should remain a mystery; he wanted to understand her,
to become friends, so that in her troubles she should
turn to him for sympathy and guidance. How wonderful
that would be, that this aloof and beautiful woman
should share with him an intimacy that she denied her
husband. He would watch her as he had watched
her the previous evening moving among her friends,
indifferent and apart from them, and they would sit, as
they had sat, hardly noticing her, talking of their own
affairs, perhaps casting towards her a glance of casual
speculation: "What is she really?" they would say,
and then put her from their mind and return to their
bridge and their billiards and their cricket shop. But
he would know, and as she turned from the window he
would appreciate the significance of that little movement,
that hesitation almost of the shoulders, and she
would turn her eyes to him, those sad, disdainful, dove-coloured
eyes of hers, that invited nothing and offered
nothing, but would become for him flooded with
sympathy and gentle friendship; there would be no
need for words&mdash;just that meeting of the eyes across a
crowded drawing-room.</p>

<p>Immersed in reverie, he walked up and down the
long grass path that ran from the cricket field to the
rose garden, and when his name was shouted suddenly,
shrilly and from very close, he approximated to that
condition of dismay that the vernacular describes as
"jumping out of one's skin." He turned, to see Muriel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
standing two yards behind him, her hands upon her
hips, shaking with laughter.</p>

<p>"I have been watching you for ten minutes," she
said as soon as she had recovered her breath, "and it's
the funniest sight I've seen; you've been walking up
and down the path with your head in the air, and your
hands clenched together behind your back, and your
lips were moving. I'm certain you were talking to
yourself. I couldn't think what you were doing. I
sat behind that bush there and watched you going up
and down and up and down, your hands clenched and
your head flung back and your lips moving, and then
at last I guessed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, what was it?"</p>

<p>"You were composing poetry. Now, don't laugh,
I'm serious, and I want to know who you were composing
it for."</p>

<p>"Well, who do you think it was?"</p>

<p>"That girl, of course."</p>

<p>"What girl?"</p>

<p>"Why, the girl you told me about yesterday!"</p>

<p>"Oh, that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes; oh, that! But you were now, weren't you?"</p>

<p>"No, I wasn't. You can't see me wasting my time
on poetry. Besides, I couldn't do it."</p>

<p>"Then, what were you doing?"</p>

<p>"Thinking."</p>

<p>"Who about?"</p>

<p>"You, of course."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she said, shaking her head, the light hair
scattering in the sunlight. "Oh, no, no, no! If you
had been thinking about me, it might have occurred to
you that I had no one in this large party to amuse me
and that I might very likely be lonely. And if you had
thought of that, and had gone on thinking that, with
your head flung back&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know all about that head."</p>

<p>"Well, if you had been thinking of me all that time,
and hadn't considered it worth your while to come and
see what I was doing, I should be very cross with you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
But as I know you weren't I don't mind. But come
along now; what was it all about?" And, sitting
down on the garden seat, she curled herself into a
corner and prepared herself for catechism. "Now,
come on," she said, "who was it?"</p>

<p>"Well, if you want to know, it was your Aunt
Beatrice."</p>

<p>Muriel pouted.</p>

<p>"Her! What do you want to think about her
for?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. She's rather interesting, don't you
think?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't," and Muriel spoke sharply in a tone
that Roland had never before encountered.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind," she said, "if you've been thinking
about Aunt Beatrice for the last ten minutes you won't
want to talk about her now. Come and have a game of
tennis."</p>

<p>And she jumped up from her seat and walked up
towards the house. Roland felt, as he prepared to
follow her, that it was an abrupt way to end a
conversation that she had forced on him.</p>

<p>And that night, as he undressed, Roland had to own
to himself that altogether it had not been a satisfactory
day. There had been the incident at the breakfast-table,
the rebuff on the croquet lawn, the coldness that
had arisen between himself and Muriel, and then,
although he had done fairly well in the cricket match,
he had not achieved the goal which, he had to confess,
had been his great incentive to prowess&mdash;namely, the
approval of Beatrice.</p>

<p>He had made twenty-seven in the first innings&mdash;a
good twenty-seven, all things considered. He had had
two yorkers in his first over. He had played a large
part in the gradual wearing down of the bowling, that
had paved the way for some heavy hitting by the tail.
He had made several very pretty shots. There had
been that late cut off the fast bowler&mdash;a beauty; he
had come down on it perfectly, and it had gone past<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
second slip out of reach of the third man for three;
and then there had been that four off the slow bowler
who had tied up Gerald so completely; he had
played him quite confidently. Mr Marston had, indeed,
complimented him on the way he had placed
the short-pitched balls in front of short-square for
singles. It had been a pretty useful innings, but
though he had kept turning his eyes in the direction of
the pavilion, and especially to the shaded side of it,
where the ladies reclined in deck-chairs, he had failed to
discover any manifestation of excitement, pleasure or
even interest on the part of Beatrice in his achievements.
True, he had once seen her hands meet in a
desultory clap, but that clap had rewarded what was,
after all, a comparatively simple hit, a half-volley outside
the off stump that he had hit past cover to the
boundary, and as that solitary clap came a full thirty
seconds after the rest of the pavilion had begun clapping,
and ceased a good thirty seconds before anyone else
clapping in the pavilion ceased, he was obliged to feel
that the applause was more the acquittal of a social
duty than any recognition of his own prowess, and when
he was finally given leg before to a ball, that would
certainly have passed a foot above the stumps, she did
not smile at him with congratulations nor did she
attempt to console him, though he gave her every
opportunity of doing so had she wished by walking
round three sides of a rectangle, and reaching the
dressing-room by means of the shaded lawn on the left
of the pavilion. No. His cricket had not interested
her in the least, and it was exasperating to see her face
kindle with enthusiasm when the wicket keeper and
the slow bowler put on fifty runs for the last wicket
through a series of the most outrageous flukes that have
ever disgraced a cricket field.</p>

<p>Not a single ball was hit along the ground and only
rarely did it follow the direction in which the bat was
swung. Length balls on the off stump flew over the
head of mid-on, of point, and second slip, to fall time
after time providentially out of reach. The fielding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
side grew exasperated; slow bowlers tried to bowl
fast and fast bowlers had a shot with lobs; full
pitches even were attempted, and these, too, were
smitten violently over the heads of the instanding
fieldsmen and out of reach of the deeps. It was a
spectacle that would at ordinary times have flung
Roland into convulsions of delight, but on this occasion
it annoyed him beyond measure. He felt as must a
music-hall artist whose high-class performance has
been received with only mild approval when he watches
the same audience lose itself in caterwauls of hilarious appreciation
at the debauched antics of a vulgar comedian
with a false nose and trousers turned the wrong way
round who sings a song about his "ma-in-law and the
boarding-house." For there was Beatrice, who had
hardly taken the trouble to watch his innings, laughing
and clapping the preposterous exhibition of this last
wicket pair. It was a real relief to him when the slow
bowler, in a desperate effort to hook an off ball to the
square by boundary, trod on his middle stump and
nearly collapsed amid the debris of the wicket.</p>

<p>Altogether it had been an unsatisfactory day and it
was typical of the whole week. He had looked forward
to it eagerly, he had meant to enjoy himself so much&mdash;the
quiet mornings in the garden, the inspection of the
wicket, the change into flannels, the varying fortune of
cricket, the long enchantment of a warm, heavy afternoon,
and afterwards the good dinner, the comradeship,
the kindly interplay of talk, till finally sleep came
to a mind at harmony with itself and full of agreeable
echoes. How good these things had seemed to him
in imagination. But, actually, there was something
missing. The weather was fine, the cricket good, the
company agreeable, but the harmony was broken. He
was disquieted. He did not wake in the morning with
that deep untroubled sense of enjoyment; he had,
instead, a belief that something was going to happen;
he was always looking to the next thing instead of
abiding contentedly in the moment.</p>

<p>And this mental turmoil could only be attributed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
to the presence of Beatrice. She disturbed him and
excited him. His eyes followed her about the room.
Whenever he was away from her he wondered what she
was doing and wished she would come back; but in
her presence he was unhappy and self-conscious. He
hardly joined in the general conversation of the table
for shyness of what she would think of him. On the
few occasions when he sat next to her he could think
of nothing to say to her, nothing, that is to say, that was
individual, that might not have been, and as a matter
of fact probably had been, said to her by every other
young man in the room.</p>

<p>He would hazard some remark about the weather&mdash;it
was rather hot: did she think there was any danger
of a thunderstorm?</p>

<p>"I hope not," she would answer; "it would spoil
everything, wouldn't it?" She assumed the voice of a
mother that is endeavouring to reassure a small child.
Cricket was like a plaything in the nursery. "That is
what she takes me for," he said to himself&mdash;"an overgrown
schoolboy"; and he prayed for an opportunity
of saying something brilliant and evocative that would
startle her into an interest for him. If only he could
lead the conversation away from heavy trivialities to
shadowy conjectures, wistful regrets; if only they
could talk of life and its disenchantments, its exquisite
gestures; of sorrow, happiness and resignation. But
how were they to talk of it? If she thought about him
at all, which was doubtful, or in any way differentiated
him from the other young men of the party, she would
probably consider that he was flattered by her gracious
inquiries about his batting average. How was she to
know what he was feeling; and how was he to introduce
so portentous a subject? He recognised with a smile
what a sensation he would cause were he to lean across
to her and say: "What do you, Mrs Arnold, consider
to be the ultimate significance of life?" His question
would be sure to coincide with one of those sudden
silences that occur unexpectedly in the middle of a meal,
and his words would fall into that pool of quivering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
silence, scattering ripples of horror and dismay. Mr
Marston would stare at him, Muriel would giggle and
say she had known all the time he was a poet, and
the other members of the party would gaze at him in
astonished pity. "Poor fellow!" their glances would
say; "quite balmy!" And Beatrice? she would
dismiss the situation with an agreeable pleasantry that
would put everyone save Roland at his ease. He did
not in the least see how he was to win her confidence.</p>

<p>His looks had not impressed her, as, indeed, why
should they? His features were neither strikingly
handsome nor strikingly ugly; they were ordinary.
He was not clever, at least his cleverness did not
transpire in conversational brilliance and repartee; and
she was not interested in cricket. He envied the ease
with which Gerald talked to her, the way they laughed
and ragged each other. They were such good friends.
It had been in Gerald's company that he had first seen
her. Was Gerald in love with her, he wondered. Gerald
had never confided to him any recent love affair, and
perhaps this was the reason. It was not unlikely. She
was young, she was lonely, she was beautiful. He
asked Muriel whether she thought there was any cause
for his anxiety.</p>

<p>"What!" she said. "Gerald and Aunt Beatrice in
love with each other!"</p>

<p>"Yes; why not. She's not in love with her husband,
and I don't see why at all&mdash;&mdash;" He stopped, for
Muriel was fixing him with a fierce and penetrative
glare.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "there's not the least danger of
Gerald falling in love with Aunt Beatrice, but if you
aren't very careful, someone else will be very soon!"</p>

<p>He laughed uncomfortably.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be silly!"</p>

<p>"So you know who I mean, don't you?"</p>

<p>"You mean me, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>He tried to dismiss the subject with a laugh.</p>

<p>"And that would never do, would it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not successful. Muriel looked more annoyed
than he had ever seen her before. It was absurd of her.
She must know that he was only ragging. They had
always been so open with one another, so charmingly
indiscreet.</p>

<p>"No, it wouldn't," she said.</p>

<p>He waited, thinking she was going to add some
qualification to this plain denial. Her lips indeed
began to frame a syllable, when in response to some
swift resolution she shook her head. "Oh, well," she
said, "it doesn't matter."</p>

<p>There was no use denying it: it had not been the
week he had expected.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a></h3>

<p class="subtitle">THE TWO CURRENTS</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Roland</span> returned home dissatisfied with himself
and anxious to vent the dissatisfaction on someone
else. He was in a mood when the least
thing would be likely to set him into a flaring temper,
and at dinner his father provided the necessary excitant.
They were considering the advisability of
having the dining-room repapered and Mr Whately
was doubting whether such an expensive improvement
would be possible for their restricted means.</p>

<p>"I don't know whether we can manage that just
now," he said. "We have had one or two little extras
this last year or so; there was that new stair carpet
and then the curtains on the second landing. I really
think that we ought to be a little careful just now. Of
course later on, when Roland and April are married&mdash;&mdash;"
And he paused to beam graciously upon his son before
completing the sentence. "As I was saying, when
Roland and April&mdash;&mdash;" But he never completed the
sentence. It remained for ever an anacoluthon. It
was that beam that did it. It exasperated Roland
beyond words. Its graciousness became idiocy.</p>

<p>"I wish you wouldn't talk like that, father," he said.
"We've heard that joke too often."</p>

<p>There was an uncomfortable silence. Mr Whately
was for a moment too surprised to speak. He had
made that little pleasantry so often that it had become
part of his conversational repertory. He could not
understand Roland's outburst; at first he was hurt;
then he felt that he had been insulted, and, like all
weak men, he was prone to stand upon his dignity.</p>

<p>"That's not the way to talk to your father, Roland."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm sorry, father, but oh, I don't know, I...."
Roland hesitated, and the matter should then have
been allowed to drop. Mrs Whately had indeed prepared
to interfere with an irrelevant comment on a
friend's theory of house decoration, but Mr Whately,
having once started on an assault, was loath to abandon
it. "No, Roland, that's not at all the way to speak to
me, and I don't know what you've got to be impatient
with me about. You know quite well that you're
going to marry April in time."</p>

<p>"I know nothing of the sort."</p>

<p>"Don't be absurd; of course you do; it was arranged
a long time ago."</p>

<p>"No, it wasn't; nothing's been arranged. We're not
engaged, and I won't have all this talk about 'when
Roland and April are married.' Do you hear? I
will not have it!"</p>

<p>It was a surprising outburst. Roland was usually
so even-tempered, and the moment afterwards he was
bitterly ashamed of himself.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," he said. "I didn't know what I was
saying."</p>

<p>For a moment his father did not answer him. Then:
"It's all right, Roland," he said; "we understand."</p>

<p>But Roland saw quite clearly he was not forgiven,
that his behaviour had increased the estrangement that
had existed between his father and himself ever since,
without asking parental advice, he had abandoned
the idea of the bank. They did not talk much after
dinner, and Mr Whately went to bed early, leaving
Roland and his mother alone. It was easier now that
he had gone.</p>

<p>"I feel such a beast," Roland said. "I don't know
what made me do it. I was worried and tired. I
didn't enjoy myself as much as I had hoped to down
at Hogstead."</p>

<p>"I know, dear, I know. We all feel like that sometimes,
but I don't see why that particular thing should
have upset you. After all, it's a very old joke of
father's; you've heard it so often before."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know, mother, I know. I don't know what it
was."</p>

<p>He could not make clear to her, if she was unable to
appreciate through her intuition, his distaste for this
harping on his marriage, this inevitable event to which
he had to come, the fate that he could in no way
avoid.</p>

<p>"Really, dear," his mother went on, "I couldn't
understand it. You haven't had any row with April,
have you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; nothing like that, nothing."</p>

<p>"Then really, dear&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know, mother, I know."</p>

<p>It was no good trying to explain to her. Could anyone
ever communicate their grief, or their happiness for
that matter, to another? Was it not the fate of every
human soul to be shut away from sympathy behind the
wall he, himself, throws up for his defence?</p>

<p>"And, dear, while we're on the question," his
mother was saying, "both father and I have been
thinking that&mdash;well, dear, you've been spending rather
a lot of money lately, and we thought that, though you
have such a certain post, you really ought to take the
opportunity of putting by a little money for setting up
your house later on. Don't you think so, dear?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so, mother."</p>

<p>"You see you've got practically no expenses now.
I know you pay us something every week, and it's very
good of you to, but you could quite easily save fifty
pounds a year."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose so."</p>

<p>"And don't you think you ought to?"</p>

<p>"I'll try, mother, I'll try."</p>

<p>She rose from her chair, walked across to him, and,
bending down, kissed his forehead.</p>

<p>"We do feel for you, dear," she said, "really we do."</p>

<p>"I know you do, mother."</p>

<p>For a long while after she had left him Roland
remained in the drawing-room; he was burdened by
a confused reaction against the influences that were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
shaping his future for him. He supposed he was in love
with April, that one day he would marry her; but was
there any need for this insistence upon domesticity?
Could he not be free a little longer? His eyes travelled
miserably round the small, insignificant drawing-room.
The window curtains had long since yielded their fresh
colour to the sunshine and hung dingily in the gaslight.
The wall-paper was shabby and tawdry, with its
festooned roses. The carpet near the door was threadbare;
the coverings to the stiff-backed chairs were
dull and crinkly. This was what marriage meant to
men and women in his position. He contrasted the
narrow room with the comfort and repose of Hogstead.
What chance did people stand whose lives were circumscribed
by endless financial difficulties, who could not
afford to surround themselves with deep arm-chairs and
heavy carpets and warm-coloured wall-papers? It was
cruel that now, at the very moment when he had begun
to escape from the drab environment of his childhood,
these fetters should be attached to him. It was cruel.
And rising from his chair he walked backwards and
forwards, up and down the room. The days of his
freedom were already numbered. They would be soon
ended, the days of irresponsible, unreflecting action. It
was maddening, this semblance of liberty where there
was no liberty. He recalled a simile in a novel he had
once read, though the name of the book and of the
author had escaped his memory, in which human beings
were described as fishes swimming in clear water, with
the net of the fisherman about them. He was like that.
He was swimming in clear water, but at any moment
the fisherman might lift the net and he would be
gasping and quivering on the bank.</p>

<p>Next day, in pitiful reaction, he presented to Mr
Marston a request to be allowed to commence his
foreign tour immediately instead of, as had been previously
arranged, in the beginning of the autumn.</p>

<p>"But, my dear fellow," Mr Marston expostulated,
"you surely don't want to go in the very middle of the
cricket season, when you're in such splendid form?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Think what games you'll be missing. There's the
Whittington match in August. We simply can't do
without you. And then there's that game against
Hogstead in September, in which you did so splendidly
last year. It's no good, my dear fellow, we simply
can't spare you."</p>

<p>But Roland was stubborn.</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry, sir," he said, "but I do feel that I
ought to be going out there soon, and July and August
will be slack months&mdash;just the time to see people and
form alliances. In the autumn they would be too busy
to worry about me."</p>

<p>Mr Marston shrugged his shoulders. It was annoying,
but still the business came first, he supposed.</p>

<p>"All right, my dear fellow. I daresay you are
right. And I am glad to see you are so keen on your
work. I only wish Gerald was."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I think he is really, sir," said Roland, who,
for one horrible moment, had a feeling that he was
playing a mean trick on Gerald. At school he had
resented the way that little Mark-Grubber Shrimpton
had gone up to Crusoe at the end of the hour to ask
his questions. He had found a nasty name for such
behaviour then, and was there so much difference
between Shrimpton's thirst for knowledge and his own
desire to travel when he might have been playing
cricket? But Mr Marston speedily reassured him.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; Gerald&mdash;he's keen enough of course, and,
after all, he's rather different. He's known all along there
was no necessity for him to over-exert himself, and I daresay
he's heard so much shop talked that he's got pretty
sick of the whole thing. You have come fresh to it."</p>

<p>"Then I may go, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, if you want to. I'll ask Mr Perkins to
make an arrangement. I expect we'll be able to get rid
of you next week."</p>

<p>And so it was arranged.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Two days before his departure, as he was bounding
downstairs on his way to lunch, Roland was suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
confronted at the turn of the staircase below the second
landing by a tall, graceful figure, in a wide-brimmed
hat and light crinkly hair. He gave a surprised gasp.
"I am so sorry," he began; then saw that it was Beatrice.
"Oh, how do you do, Mrs Arnold?" It was rather
dark and for a moment she did not recognise him.</p>

<p>"Oh, but of course&mdash;why, it's Mr Whately! And
how fortunate! I was wondering how I should ever get
to the top of these enormous stairs. I can't think why
you don't have a lift. I've come to see Gerald. Do
you think you could run and tell him I'm here? I
suppose I should have gone and asked one of your
clerks, but they do so embarrass me. Oh, thank you
so much. It is kind."</p>

<p>Within a minute Roland had returned with the news
that Gerald had already gone out to lunch, that his
secretary did not know where he had gone, but that he
had left a message stating that he was not to be expected
back before three.</p>

<p>A look of disappointment crossed her face.</p>

<p>"Oh, but how annoying!" she said. "And I had
wanted him to take me out to lunch. We haven't seen
each other for such a long time. I suppose it's my own
fault. I ought to have let him know. All the same,
thank you so much, Mr Whately."</p>

<p>She had half turned to go, when Roland, with one
of those sudden inspirations, of which a moment's
thought would have rendered him incapable, suggested
that she should come out and lunch with him instead.
"It would be so delightful for me if you would."</p>

<p>As she turned towards him, her features expressing
an obvious surprise, he wondered how on earth he had
had the courage to ask her. He had never seen her
look more beautiful than she did, standing there in the
half light of the staircase, her pale blue dress silhouetted
against the dull brown of the woodwork, and one arm
flung out along the banister. For a moment he
thought that she was going to refuse, then the look of
surprise passed into a gracious smile.</p>

<p>"But how kind of you, Mr Whately: I should love to."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>He took her to a smart but quiet restaurant that was
mostly used by city men wishing to lunch unobtrusively
with their secretaries, and they were lucky enough to
find a corner table. At first he found conversation a
little difficult; the waiter was so slow bringing the
dishes. There were uncomfortable pauses in their talk.
But by the time they had finished their fish, and drunk
a little wine, Roland's nervousness had passed. It was
a delight to look at her, a delight to listen to the soft
intonations of her voice; and here in the quiet intimacy
of the restaurant he was able to appreciate even more
acutely than at Hogstead the mystery and romance
that surrounded her. The pathos of her life was actual
to him; they were discussing a new novel that had
been much praised, but of which she had complained a
falsity to life.</p>

<p>"But then you are so different from the rest of us,"
he had said.</p>

<p>"Ah, don't say that," she replied quickly. "I'm
so anxious to be the same as all of you, to live your
life and share your interests. It's so lonely being
different."</p>

<p>She made him talk of himself, of his hopes and his
ambitions. And he told her that in two days' time he
would be going abroad.</p>

<p>"In the middle of August! Before the cricket
season's over! What horrid luck!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I wanted to go," said Roland. "I was
getting tired of things. I wanted a change."</p>

<p>She looked at him with curiosity, a new interest for
him in her deep dove-coloured eyes.</p>

<p>"You, too!" she said.</p>

<p>"I don't know what it is," Roland continued. "I
feel restless; I feel I must break loose. It's all the same,
one day after another, and what does it lead to?"</p>

<p>She leant forward, her elbows on the table, her face
resting upon the backs of her hands.</p>

<p>"Ah, don't I know that feeling," she said; "one
waits, one says, 'Something is sure to happen soon.'
But it doesn't, and one goes on waiting. And one tries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
to run away, but one can't escape from oneself."
Their eyes met and there seemed to be no further
need for words between them. Roland's thoughts
travelled into spaces of vague and wistful speculation.
A profound melancholy consumed him, a melancholy
that was at the same time pleasant&mdash;a sugared
sadness.</p>

<p>"What are you thinking of, Roland?" The use of
his Christian name caused no surprise to him; it was
natural that she should address him so. He answered
her, his eyes looking into hers.</p>

<p>"I was thinking of how we spend our whole lives
looking forward to things and looking back to things
and that in itself the thing is nothing."</p>

<p>She smiled at him. "So you've found that out
too?" she said. Then she laughed quickly. "But you
mustn't get mournful when you are with me. You've
all your life before you and you're going to be frightfully
successful and frightfully happy. I shall so enjoy
watching you. And now I must really be rushing off.
You've given me a most delightful time"; and she began
to gather up her gloves and the silk purse that hung by
a gold chain from her wrist.</p>

<p>Roland could do little work that afternoon; his
thoughts wandered from the ledger at his side and from
the files of the financial news. And that evening he
was more acutely aware than usual of the uncoloured
dreariness of his home. For him Beatrice was the
composite vision of that other world from which the
course of his life was endeavouring to lead him. She
represented, for him, romance, adventure, the flower
and ecstasy of life.</p>

<p>But two days later he felt once again, as he leant
against the taffrail to watch the English coast fade
into a dim haze, that he was letting drop from his
shoulders the accumulated responsibilities of the past
six months. Did it matter then so much what happened
to him over there behind that low-lying bank
of cloud if he could at any moment step out of his
captivity, relinquish his anxieties and enter a world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
that knew nothing of April or of his parents, that
accepted him on his own valuation as a young man
with agreeable manners and a comfortable independence?
Who that held the keys of his dungeon could
be called a prisoner?</p>

<p class="subtitle">SUCCESS</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">He</span> felt less certain of his freedom when he
watched, three months later, the white coast of
England take visible shape on the horizon. He
should have been feeling very happy. He was returning
to his friends, his home, his girl. And he was
returning with credit. He had not made, it is true,
large profits for the firm, but that had not been expected
of him. He had done what he had been told to
do. He had established important connections, made
friends with two large business men, and, incidentally,
brought several thousand pounds' worth of business
to the firm of Marston &amp; Marston. He had done
better than had been expected. When he had written
home and told Mr Marston that M. Rocheville was
prepared to sign a contract for varnish on behalf of the
Belgian Government, Mr Marston had dropped the
letter on his desk and had sat back in his chair amazed
at this good fortune; and when, a fortnight later, the
news arrived of a possible combination with the German
firm of Haupsehr &amp; Frohmann, Mr Marston had
jumped from his seat and walked backwards and forwards,
up and down the office. And for two days he
disconcerted his secretary by muttering in the middle
of his dictation: "Marvellous boy! marvellous boy!"</p>

<p>And he had been marvellous both in his fortune and
in his audacity. He had met M. Rocheville under
circumstances of ridiculous improbability. He was
dining at a small restaurant in Antwerp; he had just
ordered his meal and had commenced his study of the
wine list when he became conscious of a commotion at
the table on his left. There was a mingling of voices,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
reproachful, importunate, and one in particular
feebly explanatory. Roland listened, and gathered
from the torrent of words that the owner of the feeble
voice had lost his purse and was trying to explain that
he had friends in the town and would return and settle
the account on the next day. But the proprietor, from
a long experience of insolvent artists, actors, courtesans
and other dwellers on the fringe of respectability,
demanded a more substantial guarantee than the
card which the subject of the misfortune was offering
him.</p>

<p>"No, no," he was saying, "it is not enough; you
will leave me your watch and that ring upon your
second finger and you may go. Otherwise&mdash;&mdash;" And
he shrugged his shoulders. To this the prosperous
little gentleman, whom an empty bucket beneath the
table proved to have dined expensively, would not
agree. It was a personal affront, an insult to his
name, and he brandished his card in the face of the
proprietor; it availed little, and the intervention of the
police was imminent when Roland heard the name
"Rocheville" flung suddenly like a spear among the
waiters.</p>

<p>On the waiters it had no effect; they winked, nodded,
smiled to one another. They had heard that tale
before. Many indignant customers had flourished the
trade-mark of their reputation. Had not a poet produced
once from his pocket the review of his latest book
as a proof of his nobility? To the waiters the word
"Rocheville" meant nothing; to Roland it meant
much. The most important man in the Army Ordnance
Department was named Rocheville. He might
not be the same man, of course, but it was worth the
experiment; certainly it was worth the loss of fifty
francs that he would charge to the firm as a "special
expense."</p>

<p>He rose from his seat and walked across to M.
Rocheville.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir," he said. "I trust you will
forgive me if I am committing an impertinence, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
from what I overheard I gathered that you had lost
your purse. If that is so, please allow me to lend you
whatever you may need to settle your account."</p>

<p>"But, sir&mdash;no, really I couldn't; it would be an
unthinkable liberty."</p>

<p>But Roland insisted. And having appeased the
proprietor, who retired in a profusion of bows, he turned
again to meet M. Rocheville's thanks.</p>

<p>"But it was nothing, sir, really it was nothing,
and I could not endure the sight of a gentleman being
submitted to such an inconvenience."</p>

<p>Monsieur Rocheville executed an elaborate bow.</p>

<p>"It is too kind of you, and if you will give me your
address I will see that a cheque is sent to you
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"But I'm afraid that I go to Brussels first thing
to-morrow, and I am not certain at which hotel I shall
be stopping. But it does not matter."</p>

<p>"But it does, of course it does," M. Rocheville
expostulated. "How shall we manage it?"</p>

<p>For a moment he paused, his hand raised to his
forehead, essentially, Roland thought, the gesture of a
bureaucrat.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I have it," said M. Rocheville: "you will
come back with me to some friends of mine that live
here and we will arrange it."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Roland, "if that is so, will you
not do me the honour first of sitting at my table while
I finish my meal and sharing a bottle of wine with
me?"</p>

<p>M. Rocheville had already drunk a full bottle of
champagne, but he had lived on perquisites for so long
that he could not resist the temptation of accepting any
offer that put him under no pecuniary obligation. And,
besides, this was a confoundedly pleasant young man,
who had saved him from an undignified situation, and
in whose company he would no doubt pass agreeably
a couple of hours.</p>

<p>"I should be delighted," he said; "and do you know
my name?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm afraid not," said Roland.</p>

<p>With a slightly diffident flourish M. Rocheville handed
his card to his young companion. It was for this
moment that Roland had arranged his dramatic
sequence. He examined the card carefully, then
looked up with a surprised, half-modest, half-excited
expression on his face.</p>

<p>"You aren't&mdash;you aren't <em>the</em> Monsieur Rocheville?"</p>

<p>A slow smile spread itself over the ample features of
the bureaucrat. It was a long time since his vanity
had been so delicately tickled, and after the insults he
had received from the waiter this recognition of his
value was very pleasant.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "I suppose I am."</p>

<p>"The Monsieur Rocheville who manages the Ordnance
administration?" Roland persisted.</p>

<p>It was a sweetly sugared pill. To think that this
young foreigner should know all about him. He, himself,
was perhaps more important than he had been led to
think&mdash;a prophet in his own country; but abroad, in
England, they estimated truly the value of his services.
He was inclined to agree with them; too much praise
was given to the Generals and Commanders of Army
Corps. He always experienced a slight impatience
when he heard eulogies of the exploits of Malplaquet
and Marshal Ney and Turin. They had done the spectacular
work. The light of popular approval had to be
focused somewhere: but that in itself proved nothing.
Mankind was an ass. Was not authority delegated?
Was not the private soldier less valuable than the
colonel? Was not the colonel less valuable than
the general? In the same way might not the general
be less valuable than the organisation which provided
him with food, with cannons, with rifles; with ammunition,
and, as far as that went, with his army too. The
farther one was from the firing line the more important
one became. The organisation, was it not himself?
A sound line of argument. And he sat back contentedly
in the chair that Roland offered him and lifted
the glass that Roland had filled for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>He raised it to the light, then gently, very gently
advanced his lips to it. He rolled the rich, heavy
Volnay on his tongue. It was good. A little shudder
ran through his body. The wine had warmed him.
He sat back in his chair and smiled. It was good to be
appreciated. And Roland in this respect accommodated
him to the full. By the time Roland had finished his
dinner the old man was in a state of maudlin self-pity
and self-complacency. "I am not understood"; that
was the burden of his complaint.</p>

<p>And then, very carefully, very gently, Roland introduced
his own subject&mdash;the sale of varnish. Monsieur
Rocheville lamented the inferiority of the Belgian
species. It would not polish and it was so dear. But
what would you! The Belgians were interested only
in husbandry and food and wantonness. Monsieur
Rocheville's eyes glistened as he brought out the word,
and in another minute Roland would have been forced
to attend to a recital of the Rocheville enterprises in
the lists of gallantry; this, however, he evaded. If
varnish in Belgium was so dear, why did he not send
for it elsewhere&mdash;to Germany, or France, or Italy? He
had heard there was very good varnish to be obtained
in Italy. And when M. Rocheville advanced the theory
that one should encourage national industries, Roland
persuaded him that there was nothing that could better
encourage the Belgian varnish industry than a removal
of the Government's patronage.</p>

<p>"If they think they are certain of your custom they
won't work. Why should they? Commerce is competition.
You stimulate competition and you'll find
your industry is a hundred per cent. more healthy in
five years' time than it will be if you let it go on on the
old lines: buying dear and buying bad." M. Rocheville
agreed. How true it all was and how clearly this
young man understood it&mdash;a delightful young man, on
the whole the most delightful young man he had ever
met. It was a pity that he insisted on talking about
varnish all the time. There were so many much more
interesting things that they could have found to discuss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
together. Still, it was all very warm and nice and
comfortable.</p>

<p>Looking back the next day, and trying to reconstruct
the sequence of their conversation, M. Rocheville
found it impossible to recall the exact moment at which
Roland had stated his interest in Marston &amp; Marston's
varnish and made his proposal that the Belgian Government
would do well in the future to deal with his firm
direct. As far as he could remember, there had been
no such exact statement in so many words. They had
discussed varnish from every point of view&mdash;from the
international standpoint, from the financier's standpoint;
they had even touched on the vexed question of
retail business, and also the refractory behaviour of
trade unions. They had discussed varnish indeed so
thoroughly that it was impossible to recall what had, and
what had not, been said. One thing alone M. Rocheville
could recall with painful distinctness&mdash;that there
had come a point in the conversation when he had
realised that this engaging young man was offering to
sell him a very large quantity of varnish&mdash;good varnish&mdash;better
than the Belgian firms could supply and at the
same price. There was no question of buyer or seller,
no bargaining, no haggling. It was altogether different
from his usual harsh business interviews, that were so
distressing to a man of taste. In the same way that
this young man had rendered him assistance in that
trying altercation with the proprietor, so did he now
in this matter of varnish lay his undoubted talents and
experience at his disposal. It was a charming, friendly
action, and the young man was so business-like. He
had produced from his pocket a printed contract in
which he had made certain alterations "between
friends," he had called it, the cancellation of two or
three small clauses; he had spread the document on
the table for him to sign. He had then given M.
Rocheville a similar agreement signed by his firm, and
he had then ordered another glass of Benedictine, and
the conversation turned from varnish into more intimate
channels. He could not remember about what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
he had talked, but he felt that, at such an hour, their
comments on whatever topic they had chosen to discuss
must have been profound. In describing the occasion
to a friend he waved a hand vaguely: "For two hours,
he and I, we talked of life."</p>

<p>Then they had visited a M. Villeneuve to settle the
matter of the loan. Roland had demurred, but M.
Rocheville had insisted. And this part of the evening,
owing to the sudden change of air, he could recall more
clearly. Monsieur Villeneuve was in bed when they
arrived and did not extend to him a very cordial
welcome. But the loan was at last successfully negotiated,
and Roland then discovered that in five hours'
time he would have to catch a train and that it would
be agreeable to spend those five hours in sleep. But
M. Rocheville was very loath to part with him. For a
long while he stood in the porch and, as far as Roland
could discern any clear intention behind his confused
utterances, appeared to be suggesting that Roland
should still further trespass on the hospitality of M.
Villeneuve.</p>

<p>"Then, perhaps, if you cannot do that," M. Rocheville
persisted, "you will come and spend a week-end
with me before you return. You have my card. I
have a nice house in Brussels, very quiet and comfortable.
I am not married."</p>

<p>But Roland had reminded him that he was very busy,
and that he did not know if he would have time, but
that he would certainly try to arrange a lunch at their
next visit.</p>

<p>"And in the meantime I will see that you get that
varnish."</p>

<p>"Ah! that varnish," said M. Rocheville. And
observing that he was now standing alone in the porch,
with no one to whom he might address his profound
reflections upon the mortality of man, he walked
slowly towards the gate, a little puzzled by Roland's
conduct and by his own.</p>

<p>"A delightful young man," he said, then paused
as though he must qualify this estimate, but his Latin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
cynicism saved him. "Well, well," he said, "an
agreeable interlude."</p>

<p>That was Roland's first triumph, and the other, if
less adroitly stage-managed, was more audacious, and
owed its success to skill as much as to good fortune.</p>

<p>Haupsehr &amp; Frohmann directed one of the largest
polish factories in the south of Germany; they supplied,
indeed, practically the whole of the Rhineland with
their goods, and Roland had considered that a meeting
between them might prove profitable. He found,
however, that it was impossible to obtain an interview
with either Herr Haupsehr or Herr Frohmann. "They
will not look at English goods." That was what everyone
told him, and a carefully worded request for an interview
that he addressed to the head of the firm was
answered by return of post with a bald statement that
Herren Haupsehr and Frohmann did not consider a
personal interview would further the interests of either
Mr Roland Whately, representative of Marston &amp;
Marston, or of themselves. And Roland was thus
driven to the reluctant conclusion that his advisers
were correct. If he were to effect an introduction it
would have to be done by guile.</p>

<p>He awaited his opportunity, and the opportunity
came to him in the passport office. He had gone to
fulfil some trifling by-law concerning the registration
of aliens. For a long time he had sat in a draughty
corridor, and then for a long time he had stood beside
a desk while a busy bureaucrat attended to someone
else's business, and when at last he had succeeded in
making his application a bell rang in the next room,
and without an apology his interlocutor rose from his
chair and hurried to the next room.</p>

<p>"How terrified they are of their chiefs," Roland
thought. He had by now become accustomed to the
trepidation of officials. How typical was that desk of
the words that were written and the sentences framed
at it; precise, firm, tabulated and impersonal: the
plain brass inkstand, with red and black inkpots;
the two pens, the blotter, the calendar, the letter files,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
the box for memoranda; and the mind of that fussy
little official was exactly like his desk, and, leaning
over, Roland tried to see to whom the letter on the
blotter was addressed.</p>

<p>As he did so, his eye fell on a slip of pasteboard that
had been put behind the inkstand. It was a calling
card, the calling card of a Herr Brumenhein, and on
the top, in handwriting, was inscribed the words:
"To introduce bearer." The name Brumenhein was
familiar to Roland, though in what connection he could
not recall. At any rate, the fact that he recollected
the name at all proved that it was the appendage of an
important person, and as it was always useful to possess
the means of being introduced under the auspices of a
celebrity, Roland picked up the card and placed it in
his pocket-book.</p>

<p>When he returned to the hotel he made inquiries
about the unknown patron, and learned that Herr
Brumenhein was a very distinguished Prussian minister,
and one who was honoured by the confidence of the
Crown Prince. "He will be a great man one day,"
said the hotel proprietor.</p>

<p>"As great as Griegenbach?"</p>

<p>"Who knows?&mdash;perhaps, and it is said the Crown
Prince is not too fond of Griegenbach."</p>

<p>And then Roland's informant proceeded to enlarge on
the exaggerated opinion Griegenbach had held of his
own value since his successful Balkan diplomacy. "He
thinks he is indispensable and he makes a great mistake.
No one is indispensable. The post of minister is more
important than the man who fills it."</p>

<p>Roland, of course, agreed; he always agreed with
people. It was thus that he had earned the reputation
of being good company, and at this moment, even if he
had held contrary opinions as to the relations of the
moment and the man, he would have been unable to
develop them in an argument. He was too busy
wondering how best he could turn this discovery to his
advantage. And it was not long before the thought
was suggested to him that this card might very easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
procure him the desired interview with Herr Haupsehr.
It was a risky game of course, but then what wasn't
risky in high finance? It was quite possible that
Herren Haupsehr and Brumenhein were the oldest of
friends, that awkward questions would be asked and
his deceit discovered. But, even if it was, he could, at
the worst, only be kicked downstairs, and that was an
indignity he could survive. It would destroy for ever
the possibility of any negotiations between himself and
the German firm, but that, also, was no serious drawback,
for, as things were, there seemed little enough
prospect of opening an account. He could not see how
he would be in any the worse position were he to fail,
whereas if he brought it off.... It was a dazzling
thought.</p>

<p>And so at eleven o'clock next morning Roland
presented himself at the entrance of Herr Haupsehr's
office. He asked no questions; he made no respectful
inquiry as to whether at that moment Herr Haupsehr
was, or was not, engaged. He assumed that whatever
occupied that gentleman's attention would be
instantly removed on the announcement that a friend
of Herr Brumenhein's was in the building. Roland
said nothing. He flourished his card in the face of
the young lady who stood behind the door marked
"Inquiries."</p>

<p>"You wish to see Herr Haupsehr?"</p>

<p>Roland bowed, and the young lady disappeared.
She returned within a minute.</p>

<p>"If you will please to follow me, sir."</p>

<p>He was conducted through the counting-house and
into the main corridor, up a flight of stairs, along
another corridor, till they reached a door marked
"Private," before which the young lady stopped.
Roland made an interrogatory gesture of the hand
towards it.</p>

<p>"If you please, sir," she said.</p>

<p>Roland did not knock at the door. He turned the
handle and entered the room with the gracious condescension
of a general who is forced to visit a company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
office. It was a large room, with a warm fire and easy-chairs
and an old oak desk. But Herr Haupsehr was
not sitting at his desk: he had advanced into the
centre of the room, where he stood rubbing his hands
one against the other. Some men reach a high position
through truculence, others through subservience, and
Herr Haupsehr belonged to the second class. He was
a little man with a bald head and with heavy pouches
underneath his eyes. He fidgeted nervously, and it
was hard to recognise in this obsequious figure the
dictator of that letter of stern refusal.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "you are a friend of Herr Brumenhein?"
In the eyes of Herr Haupsehr had appeared
annoyance and a slight distrust at the sight of so young
a visitor, but the sound of the magic name recalled him
to servility.</p>

<p>"Yes," he repeated, "yes; and what is it that I may
have the honour to do for a friend of Herr Brumenhein?"</p>

<p>Roland made no immediate reply. He drew off his
gloves slowly, finger by finger, and placed them in the
pockets of his great-coat, which garment he then proceeded
to remove and lay across the back of one of the
comfortable, deep arm-chairs. He then took out his
pocket-book, abstracted from it a card and handed it to
Herr Haupsehr. So far he had not spoken a word.
Herr Haupsehr examined the card carefully, raising it
towards the light, for he was shortsighted, and found
the unusual English lettering trying to his eyes. He
read out the words slowly: "Mr Roland Whately,
Marston &amp; Marston, Ltd." He stretched his head
backwards, so that his gaze was directed towards the
ceiling. "Mr Roland Whately, Marston &amp; Marston,
Ltd...." the name was familiar, but how and in
what connection? There were so many names. He
shook his head. He could not remember, but it did
not matter. Roland had watched him anxiously; he
had mistrusted that gaze towards the ceiling, and it
was a big relief when Herr Haupsehr stretched out
his hand and indicated one of the large arm-chairs&mdash;"And
what is it that I can do for you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>Roland then began to outline the scheme that had
suggested itself to him. The scheme was to the advantage
of the German as well as to himself. Haupsehr &amp;
Frohmann were the biggest dealers in polish in South
Germany. That was granted. But there were rivals,
very dangerous rivals, the more dangerous because
they were specialists, each of them, in one particular
line of polish, and a specialist was always better, if more
expensive, than a general dealer. Now what Roland
suggested was that Haupsehr should devote his attention
solely to metal polish, should become specialists in
a large sense, and that he should rely for the varnish
solely on Marston &amp; Marston.</p>

<p>"Don't worry about varnish," Roland said: "we'll
let you have it a lot cheaper than these rivals of yours
can produce it at. There won't be much actual profit
in it for you, not directly, but it will allow you
to put all your capital into the metal polish and,
by smashing your rivals, it'll leave you with a clear
market."</p>

<p>The German considered the plan. It was a good one,
he could see its advantages. He would be trading, of
course, with a nation for which he had no great affection,
but, even so, Herr Brumenhein apparently thought well
of it.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he thought it a capital idea," said Roland.
"He's most anxious to see trade alliance between
Great Britain and Germany. He's so afraid there may
be ill-feeling. I told him that that was, of course,
absurd, but still&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said Herr Haupsehr, "I see, of course;
but there are difficulties, grave difficulties."</p>

<p>Roland could see that he was beginning to waver,
that he was anxious to postpone his decision, and that
would, of course, be fatal. Roland had learnt early
that when a man says to you: "Look here, I can't
decide now, but I'll write and let you know in a day
or two," he has already decided against you. And so
Roland played Herr Brumenhein for all he was worth.
Having discovered that Herr Haupsehr had never met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
the great man, Roland felt himself at liberty to tell his
story as amply as possible.</p>

<p>"But you should meet him," he said; "a most
charming companion. He comes over and stays with
us nearly every summer."</p>

<p>"Really! Every summer?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, nearly always. And he's the coming man,
of course. Not a doubt of it. Griegenbach's day is
done."</p>

<p>Herr Haupsehr affected surprise. He respected
every minister till he was out of office.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, not a doubt of it. He thinks he's more
important than his job&mdash;a big mistake. A minister's
post is more important than the man who fills it."</p>

<p>With that Herr Haupsehr agreed. Himself had
revered authority all his life. This young man showed
considerable sagacity. The job was bigger, always
bigger, than the man.</p>

<p>"Yes, he's the coming man," Roland went on; "we
can see it more clearly over in England perhaps than you
can over here. If I were a German I would back Herr
Brumenhein with every bit of influence I possessed."</p>

<p>And, indeed, so admirably did he present the future
greatness of Herr Brumenhein that Herr Haupsehr got
the impression that he had only to agree to these
varnish proposals to be offered an important post in the
ministry. It was not stated in so many words, but
that was the suggestion. And, in the end, preliminary
arrangements were drawn up and a contract signed.
Herr Haupsehr showed Roland to the door with intense
civility.</p>

<p>"And I was wondering," he said, "do you think it
would be altogether wise if I were to write personally
to Herr Brumenhein and tell him that I have met you
and agreed to your plan? Would it be wise?" And
he stood nervously fidgeting from one foot to the other&mdash;the
eternal sycophant.</p>

<p>Roland scratched his chin thoughtfully. Then, after
a moment's deliberation:</p>

<p>"No," he said. "On the whole, no. I don't think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
it would be wise. Herr Brumenhein is very busy. I
think it would be better to wait till he visits us again in
England and I shall tell him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You will tell him all about me and my willingness,
yes?"</p>

<p>"Of course, of course."</p>

<p>"You are too kind, sir; too kind."</p>

<p>"Aufwiedersehn."</p>

<p>"Aufwiedersehn."</p>

<p>Hands were shaken, the door closed, and Roland was
in the passage, the contract safe in his breast pocket.</p>

<p>With two such feats accomplished Roland should
certainly have been returning home with a light heart.
He would be praised and made much of. For at least
a fortnight conversation would centre round his exploits.
His return was that of a general entering his
city after a successful battle&mdash;a Roman triumph. But
for all that he was dispirited. On his journey out he
had experienced the exhilaration of freedom, and on
his return he was obsessed by the gloom of impending
captivity. To what, after all, was he coming back?&mdash;worries,
responsibilities, the continual clash of
temperaments. How fine had been the independent
life of vagabondage that he had just left, where he
could do what he liked, go where he liked, be bound
to no one. There had been a time when the sights and
noises of London had been inexpressibly dear to him.
His heart had beaten fast with rapture on his return
from Fernhurst, when he had watched the green fields
vanish beneath that sable shroud of roofs and chimney-stacks.
But now there was no magic for him in the
great city through which he was being so swiftly driven.
Autumn had passed to winter; the plane-trees were
bare; dusk was falling; the lamplighter had begun his
rounds. For many it was a moment of hushed wonderment,
of peace and benediction, but Roland stirred
irritably in the corner of his cab, and there was no
pleasure for him in the effusive welcome his mother
accorded him. He did his best to respond to it, but
it was a failure, and she noticed it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's the matter, darling? Wasn't it a success?
Didn't you do well over there?"</p>

<p>And behind her evident anxiety Roland detected,
or fancied that he could detect, the suggestion of a hope
that he had not done so well as he had expected.</p>

<p>"She would like to have comforted me," he thought.
"Her husband has been a failure; he has had to depend
upon her and so she has kept his love. She would like
me to be the same." And this attitude, although he
could understand it, exasperated him. He was aware
that through his new friends he had become alienated
from her, that she must be lonely now. But what
would you? Life went that way.</p>

<p>They had tea together, and though Roland spoke
amusingly and with animation about his experiences
abroad, their talk was not intimate as it had been.
There was nothing said behind and apart from their
actual words, and Mrs Whately imagined that he was
impatient to see April.</p>

<p>As soon as they had finished tea she suggested that
he should go round to her.</p>

<p>"I'm sure you must be longing to see her."</p>

<p>And when he had gone, she sat for a little while in front
of the unwashed tea-things thinking how hard it was
that a mother should have to yield her son to another
woman.</p>

<p>She need not have. Roland, at the moment when
she was thinking of him with melancholy regret, was
far from being "dissolved in pleasure and soft repose."
He was sitting, as he had so often sat before, on the
chair beside the window-seat, in which April was
forlornly curled, while Mrs Curtis expressed, to complete
his depression, her opinion on the economic situation
in Europe. Soon she abandoned these matters of high
finance and reverted to simple matters of to-day&mdash;namely,
her son and her daughter. It was "dear
April" and "dear Arthur"; and Roland was reminded
vividly of a bawdy house in Brussels and the old woman
who had sat beside the fire, exhibiting her wares. That
was what Mrs Curtis was at heart. He could see her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
two thousand years earlier administering in some
previous existence to the lusts of Roman soldiery:
"Yes, a dear girl, Flavia; and Julia, she's nice; and
if you like them plump Portia's a dear, sweet girl&mdash;so
loving. Dacius Cassius said to me only yesterday...."
Yes, that was what she was, and beneath her sentimentality
how cold, how hard, how merciless, like that
woman in Brussels who had taken eighty per cent. of the
girls' money. He was continuing to draw comparisons
with a vindictive pleasure when he observed that she
was collecting her knitting preparatory to a move.</p>

<p>"But I know you two'll want to be together. I
won't be a troublesome chaperon," she was saying;
"I'll get out of your way. I expect you've lots to say
to each other."</p>

<p>And before Roland quite knew what was happening
he was alone with April. He turned towards her, and
as her eyes met his she blushed a little and smiled, a
shy, wavering smile that said: "I am here; take me
if you want me, I am yours"&mdash;a smile that would have
been to anyone else indescribably beautiful, but that
to Roland, at that moment, appeared childish and
absurd. He did not know what to say. He was in no
mood for protestations and endearments. He could
not act a lie. There was an embarrassing pause. April
turned her face away from him. He said nothing, he
did nothing. And then very distinctly, very slowly,
like a child repeating a lesson:</p>

<p>"Did you have a good crossing?" The tension was
broken; he began to talk quickly, eagerly, inconsequently&mdash;anything
to prevent another such moment.
And then Mrs Curtis came back and the conversation
was monopolised, till Roland reminded her that it was
seven o'clock and that he would have to be getting back.</p>

<p>"I haven't seen my father yet."</p>

<p>"Of course, of course. We mustn't keep him, must
we, April?"</p>

<p>Roland took his leave, but April did not, as was
usual, follow him to the door. She remained huddled
in the window-seat, and did not even turn her head in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
his direction. She was angry with him, and no doubt
with good cause, he reflected; but Mrs Curtis had gone so
suddenly; he had been taken off his guard. Heavens!
but what a home-coming!</p>

<p>He felt happier though next morning when he walked
into the office of Marston &amp; Marston. Everyone was
pleased to see him back: the girls in the counting-house
smiled at him. He was informed by the lift-boy
that his cricket had been sadly missed during the later
half of the season, and Mr Stevens literally leapt from
his desk to shake him by the hand. It was ripping to
see Gerald again, to come into his room and hear that
quietly drawled: "Well, old son," and resume, as he
had left it, their old friendship.</p>

<p>"The governor's awfully pleased with you," said
Gerald, "never seen the old boy so excited over anything
before. He's been talking about nothing else.
He keeps on saying: 'The fellow who can make fifty
runs in half-an-hour can run a business.' But I'm
damned if I know how you did it. I've gone over
there with carefully prepared introductions and had a
chat with a few johnnies, but you seem to have gone
pirating about, holding up Government officials and
boosting into financiers' offices. How's it done?"</p>

<p>Roland laughed.</p>

<p>"That's my secret."</p>

<p>"You are welcome to it," said Gerald; "and tell me,
did you have any real adventures?"</p>

<p>"One or two."</p>

<p>"Where? Good ones?"</p>

<p>"Not bad. Brussels, the usual place."</p>

<p>Gerald shook his head. "You should give it up, old
son, it isn't worth it."</p>

<p>Roland laughed. "I like your talking! Why, I
never knew such a fellow as you for women."</p>

<p>"For women, yes, but not professionals."</p>

<p>"That's much worse."</p>

<p>But Gerald shook his head. "No, it isn't, my son.
No man ever got any good yet out of going with
professionals."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>But before Roland had had time to elucidate this
riddle Mr Marston had entered the room. He took
Roland's hand in his and shook it heartily.</p>

<p>"This is splendid, my dear fellow, splendid! They
told me you'd come back and I knew where I should
find you. It's good to have you back, and you've
done splendidly&mdash;far better, I don't mind telling you,
than any of us expected. We all looked on this as a
sort of trial. But, my word, you've brought it off."</p>

<p>"I've been telling him, father, that you've been
going round London saying that the man who can
make fifty runs in half-an-hour is sure to be able to
run a business."</p>

<p>"And it's true," said Mr Marston, "it's true. If a
man's got the pluck to face a ticklish situation at
cricket, he can do anything. Business is only bluff,
like cricket, making the bowler think you're set when
you're really expecting every ball will be your last. If
I've said it to Gerald once I've said it fifty times. 'My
boy,' I've said, 'if you don't do another stroke of work
in your life you'll be worth a salary of five hundred
pounds a year for having brought young Whately to
us.' Now come along and let's go over those accounts."</p>

<p>They spent over an hour together, and at the end of
it Mr Marston rose from his desk perfectly satisfied.</p>

<p>"As far as I can see you haven't made a slip. It's
first class absolutely. Now, you run along to Perkins
and settle up your personal accounts with him, and
then we'll go out and have lunch somewhere together,
the three of us, and you can spend the afternoon at
home. I daresay your girl's been missing you."</p>

<p>"I haven't got a girl, sir."</p>

<p>"What! a young fellow like you not got a girl! We
shall have to see about that. Why, at your age I seem
to remember...." And the old man winked his eye
and chuckled gaily.</p>

<p>Perkins received Roland with considerable politeness,
mingled for the first time with respect, also, Roland
suspected, with a more deep dislike.</p>

<p>"Well, so you're back, are you? And they all tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
me you've been doing great things&mdash;interviewing
Government officials."</p>

<p>"I've had a bit of luck."</p>

<p>"Useful luck?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so."</p>

<p>"And now you want me to have a look at the
accounts?"</p>

<p>"That's it."</p>

<p>"Right; bring them along."</p>

<p>Roland laid out his personal accounts, his hotel bills,
his railway fares, his entertaining expenses.</p>

<p>"And, as far as I can see," he said, "there's a balance
of about thirteen pounds in your favour."</p>

<p>"We'll have a look and see," said Mr Perkins, and
he began to scrutinise the accounts carefully, adding
up every bill, and checking the amount of the German
balance-sheet. Roland had taken a great deal of
trouble over these accounts. He would not have
minded making a few slips in the figures he had placed
before Mr Marston, but he was desperately anxious to
present no weak spot to Perkins.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said Perkins, "these seem to be all
right, and there's a balance, as you say, of thirteen
pounds, five and threepence."</p>

<p>"Right," said Roland, and began to count out the
money.</p>

<p>"Yes, but as far as I can see, there aren't any&mdash;well,
how shall I put it?&mdash;any special expense accounts
here. I usually let one or two of them through all
right."</p>

<p>"No, I've stated what all my charges are for."</p>

<p>"Well, then, aren't there one or two little things?
Usually you young gentlemen like to have a few extras
put down." And his face, that was turned to Roland's,
assumed a cunning, knowing smile, an unpleasant
smile, the smile of a man in a subservient position who
enjoys the privilege of being able to confer a favour on his
superior, and at the same time despises his superior for
asking it. Roland had known that it was in exactly
this way that Perkins would offer to slip through a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
special expense account. He knew that by accepting
this offer he would place himself eternally in Perkins's
debt. That, as in Gerald's case, there would be
between them an acknowledged confederacy. This
he would never have. He had, as a matter of fact,
incurred very few of the special expenses to which
Perkins referred. He had worked hard; he had been
alone. Solitary indulgence is never very exciting; one
wants companionship, as in everything, and so he had
confined his excesses to a couple of visits to a discreet
establishment in Brussels, of which he had decided to
defray the cost himself.</p>

<p>He was able, therefore, to meet Perkins's leer with a
look of puzzled interrogation.</p>

<p>"I don't quite understand, Mr Perkins. I think
you've all my accounts there, and I owe you thirteen
pounds, five shillings and threepence; perhaps you'll
give me a receipt."</p>

<p>In the look that they exchanged as Mr Perkins respectfully
handed Roland the receipt, each recognised
the beginning of a long antagonism.</p>

<p>"Thanks very much, Mr Perkins."</p>

<p>Roland walked out of the room jauntily. He had
had the best of the first skirmish.</p>

<p>This victory put him on excellent terms with himself,
and, later, a bottle of excellent Burgundy at lunch
wooed him to so kindly a sympathy for his fellow-beings
that any leader of advanced political opinions would
have found him an easy victim to any theory of world-brotherhood.
As, however, no harbinger of the new
world accosted him on his way from the City to Charing
Cross Station, Roland was free to focus his entire
sympathy upon the forlorn figure of April. He thought
of her suddenly just outside Terry's Theatre, and the
remembrance of his behaviour to her on the night
before caused him to collide violently with an elderly
gentleman who was walking in the opposite direction.
But he did not stop to apologise; his sentimentality
held a mirror to his guilt. What a selfish beast he had
been. How miserable he must have made her. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
must have so looked forward to his return. He had
hardly written to her while he had been away. Poor
little April, so sweet, so gentle. A wave of tenderness
for her consumed him. They had shared so much
together; he had confided in her his hopes and his
ambitions. He worked himself into a temper of
self-abasement. He must go to her at once and beg
forgiveness.</p>

<p>He found her sitting in the arm-chair before the fire.
She raised her eyes in mild amazement, surprised that
he should visit her at such a time. She did not know
how she should comport herself. Her dignity told her
that she should rise and receive him coldly, but her
instinct counselled her to remain seated and hear what
he had to say. She obeyed her instinct. Roland
flung his hat and stick on the cushioned window-seat
and precipitated himself at her feet. She tried to
push him away, but his voice murmuring the word
"darling" overmastered her, and she let him put
his arms round her and draw her head upon his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"I feel such a beast, April, such a beast. All the day
I have been cursing myself and wondering what on
earth possessed me. I don't know what it was. But
all the time I've been away I've been so looking forward
to seeing you again. When I was all alone and unhappy
I said to myself: 'Never mind, April's waiting,'
and I thought how wonderful to see you again, and
then&mdash;&mdash;Oh, I don't know, but when I came here last
night and found your mother here&mdash;I don't know!
All the time I was dying to speak to you, and she
would go on talking, and I got more and more annoyed.
And then, I don't know how it happened, but I
found myself getting angry with you because of your
mother."</p>

<p>"But you mustn't, Roland, really you mustn't.
You shouldn't speak of mother like that; you know
how good she's been to us."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I know it, of course I do. But can't you
see what it was like last night for me coming back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
you, and wanting you, and then to hear only your
mother; and by the time she left us alone I had got so
bad tempered that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, you weren't very nice, were you?"</p>

<p>And he had begun to pour out a further torrent of
explanation when he saw that a sly, mischievous smile
was playing round the corners of her mouth and that
she was no longer angry.</p>

<p>"Then you'll forgive me?" he said.</p>

<p>"But I don't know about that."</p>

<p>"Oh, but you have, haven't you? I know you
have."</p>

<p>She began to remonstrate, to say that she had not
forgiven him, that he had been most unkind to her, but
she made no resistance when his hand slipped slowly
round her neck and turned her face to his. And as he
raised it, she pouted ever so slightly her lips towards
those that sank to meet them. As their mouths met
she passed one hand behind his head and pressed it
down to her. It was a long embrace, and when she drew
back from it, the lustre of her eyes had grown dimmed
and misty.</p>

<p>"You've never kissed me like that before," she said.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I've never really loved you before."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I should hate to think that."</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. I'm silly, but if you only love
me now, then before&mdash;oh, it doesn't matter, you love
me now, don't you?"</p>

<p>And he answered her in the only possible way.</p>

<p>One hour they had together, an hour of rich enchantment.
The blinds were drawn, the lamp unlighted;
she sat on the floor with the firelight playing over her,
leant back against him while he told her of Bruges and
its waterways, the proud boulevards of Brussels, the
great cathedral at Köln, the noble sweep of the Rhine
and the hills on either side of it. She followed little of
what he said to her; it was enough for her, after three
long months, to be soothed by his presence, to hear his
voice, to hold his hand in hers, and to feel from time to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
time his breath grow warm upon her neck and cheek
as he bent to kiss her. It was the tenderest hour their
love had brought to them.</p>

<p>But for Roland it was followed by a reaction. He
felt, in a confused manner, that he had been playing a
part, that he had said what was but half true. He had
certainly been exasperated by Mrs Curtis's conversation,
but it was her talk, the supreme futility of her talk, that
had exasperated him. It had annoyed him in itself
and not as being a barrier between himself and April.
He had told a lie.</p>

<p>And it was not for the first time, he reminded himself.
Half lies had been an essential part of their love-making.
At every crisis of their relationship he had tampered
with the truth. He had told her he had only made
love to Dolly because she had rejected him that evening
at the ball. He had told her that it was her belief in
him that had inspired his success at Hogstead. He
had mistaken the fraction for the whole. Were they
never to meet on terms of common honesty? What
was their love worth if it had to live on lies?</p>

<p>He returned home to find the drawing-room fire
almost out.</p>

<p>"Will these servants never do their work?" he
grumbled.</p>

<p>That evening the soup plates happened to be cold
and the joint overdone.</p>

<p>"It gets worse every day," he said. "I don't know
what that girl thinks she's paid for. She never does
anything right."</p>

<p>And when he went upstairs to turn on a bath he
discovered that all the hot water had been used in washing
up the plates. He returned to the drawing-room in
a fury of impatience.</p>

<p>"I do wish, mother," he said, "that you'd explain to
Lizzie that there's no need for her to wash herself as well
as the plates in that sink of hers."</p>

<p>"And I wish you wouldn't grumble the whole time,
Roland," his mother retorted. "Lizzie's got a great
deal to do. She has to do the cooking as well as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
housework. I think that, on the whole, she manages
very well."</p>

<p>"I am glad you think so," said Roland, and walked
out of the room.</p>

<p>Next morning he found on his plate a letter from
Mrs Marston, inviting him down for the week-end.</p>

<p>"It seems such a long time since that cricket week,"
she wrote, "and we all want to congratulate you on
your splendid work. So do come."</p>

<p>He handed the letter across to his mother.</p>

<p>She raised her eyebrows interrogatively.</p>

<p>"Well, dear?"</p>

<p>"Of course I shall go."</p>

<p>She did not answer him, and he read in her silence a
disapproval.</p>

<p>"You don't want me to," he said.</p>

<p>"I don't mind, dear. It's for you to decide."</p>

<p>"But you'd rather I didn't?"</p>

<p>"Well, dear, I was only thinking that as you've
been away from us for three months, and...."</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, and what?"</p>

<p>"Well, dear, to go away, the very first week-end."</p>

<p>"But you'll be seeing lots of me all the week."</p>

<p>"I wasn't thinking of us, though of course we like to
have you here. It was April; don't you think it might
rather hurt her feelings?"</p>

<p>"Oh, bother April!"</p>

<p>"But, dear...."</p>

<p>"I know, mother, but it's April this and April that;
it's nothing but April."</p>

<p>His mother raised to him a surprised, grieved face,
but she made no answer, and Roland, standing beside
the table, experienced the sensation of an anxious
actor who has finished his speech in the middle of the
stage and does not know how to reach the wings.</p>

<p>"You see, mother," he began, but she raised a hand
to stop him.</p>

<p>"No, dear, don't explain: I understand."</p>

<p>He cursed himself, as he walked to the bus, for his ill-temper.
What a beast he was&mdash;first to April, then to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
his mother; the two people for whom he cared most in
the world. What was wrong? Why was he behaving
like this? It had not been always so. At school he
had had a reputation for good-naturedness&mdash;"a social
lubricant," someone had called him&mdash;and at Hogstead
he was still the same, cheerful, good-humoured, willing
to do anything for anyone else. He became his old self
in the company of Gerald and his father and the light-hearted,
irresponsible Muriel. It was only at Hammerton
that he was irritable and quick to take offence. His
ill-humour fell away from him, however, the moment
he reached the office.</p>

<p>"Well, old son," said Gerald, "and did you get a
letter from the mater this morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you're coming?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know yet."</p>

<p>"Oh, but of course you are. They'll all be fearfully
annoyed if you don't, especially Muriel&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Muriel! Why, what did she say?"</p>

<p>"Nothing particular as far as I remember, but she
seemed frightfully keen. She says you're the only one
of my friends she's any use for. She finds them too
stuck up&mdash;middle-aged at twenty she calls them. So
you'll have to come."</p>

<p>"I suppose I shall."</p>

<p>"Of course you will. Sit down and write a note this
minute, so that there's no chance of your thinking
better."</p>

<p>When Roland returned home that night his mother
made no reference to the scene at the breakfast table.
They spoke at dinner of indifferent things, politics and
personalities; but there was a brooding atmosphere
of disquiet. Not until nearly bedtime did Ronald
announce his intention of going down to Hogstead.
His mother's reply expressed neither reproach nor
disappointment.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," she said; "well, I hope you'll enjoy
yourself."</p>

<p>And just because her voice was even and unchal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>lenging, Roland felt that he had to give some
explanation.</p>

<p>"You see, mother, Mr Marston is, after all, my boss,
and these visits&mdash;well, they're rather a royal command.
They'd be a bit annoyed if I didn't go."</p>

<p>"Of course, dear, of course. We only want you to
do what you think best."</p>

<p>But he knew that she was disappointed. She was
right, too. He supposed he ought really to have stayed
at home and gone for a walk with April. He felt guilty
in his attitude towards April, guilty and, in a way,
resentful, resentful against these repeated demands on
his time and energy, against this assumption of an
unflagging passion, an eternal intoxication. And yet
he did feel guilty. Was he treating her as a boy
ought to treat his girl? How rarely, for example,
had he ever taken her anywhere. Ah, well, that at
least he could remedy.</p>

<p>Next day, during his lunch hour, he went round to the
box office of the Adelphi and bought three stalls for
Thursday night. He returned home with the happy air
of one that carries a delightful surprise in his pocket.</p>

<p>"Mother," he said, "what are you doing on Thursday
night?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, dear, as far as I know."</p>

<p>"Well, would you like to come out somewhere with
me?"</p>

<p>"You know I always like to go out anywhere with
you."</p>

<p>"And April?"</p>

<p>"Of course, dear."</p>

<p>"Well, then, what do you say to a dinner in Soho
and the Adelphi afterwards?"</p>

<p>"But, dear&mdash;oh, you don't mean it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do, mother. I wanted to celebrate my
return, so I got the three seats. I've booked the table,
and there we are."</p>

<p>Her face flushed with pleasure.</p>

<p>"Oh, but you shouldn't have, really you shouldn't,
and you don't want me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course we do, mother, and anyhow we could
hardly go alone."</p>

<p>"And have you told April?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm just off to tell her."</p>

<p>He bent down, kissed her, then straightened himself
and ran out of the room. She heard his footsteps
clatter on the stairs, then move about in the bedroom
above her, and then once more clatter on the stairs. She
sighed, her eyes dimming a little, but glad, inexpressibly
glad, that he should still need her in his happiness.</p>

<p>Roland found April alone.</p>

<p>"I've got a surprise for you," he said.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"What do you think?"</p>

<p>"A box of chocolates."</p>

<p>"Do you want a box of chocolates?"</p>

<p>"I should like one."</p>

<p>"Right! Then I'll go and get you one." And he
turned towards the door, but she ran after him and
caught him by the sleeve of his coat.</p>

<p>"Don't be silly," she said; "come back!"</p>

<p>"But you said you wanted a box of chocolates."</p>

<p>"But I want to know what your surprise is first?"</p>

<p>"Well, then, have a look in my pockets and see if you
can find it."</p>

<p>She put both her hands in his coat pockets, and
quickly, before she knew what he was doing, his arms
were round her, and he had drawn her close to him.
Her hands were prisoners in his pockets and she was
powerless. Slowly he put his face to hers and kissed
her.</p>

<p>"That's not fair," she said.</p>

<p>"It's very nice."</p>

<p>"I daresay, but I want to know what your surprise
is?"</p>

<p>For answer he placed the envelope in her hand; she
looked puzzled, but when she had opened it she gave a
little cry of delight.</p>

<p>"Oh, Roland, how dear of you!"</p>

<p>"Then you'll come?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course. Oh, Roland, dear! It's years since I
went to a theatre. I shall love it."</p>

<p>He was delighted with the success of his plan. He
felt happy and confident. How pretty, how charming
April was; how much he was in love with her. He took
her on his knee and insisted on rearranging her hair.</p>

<p>"But you're only making it worse," she complained.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I'm not; I'm getting on splendidly. You
just wait and see," and he continued to stroke her hair,
dividing it so that he could kiss her neck.</p>

<p>"It's in an awful state," she said, "and someone is
sure to come before I can tidy it."</p>

<p>"Don't you worry," he said, drawing his fingers
along the curved roll of hair. And then suddenly it all
came down; the long tresses fell in a cascade about
them, covering them in a fine brown net.</p>

<p>"Oh, you beast, you beast!" she said, struggling to
get up.</p>

<p>But he held her close.</p>

<p>"Oh, no; it's ripping like that. You look lovely."</p>

<p>"Do I?"</p>

<p>"And, look, I can kiss you through your hair," and
he drew a thin curl across her mouth and laid his upon
it, moving his lips slightly up and down till he had
drawn the hair into their mouths and their lips could
meet.</p>

<p>"But you did it on purpose, I'm sure you did. It
couldn't have happened like that of its own, all of a
sudden."</p>

<p>"Well, what if it didn't! You look simply ripping."</p>

<p>She laughed happily, hiding her face upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>"It's very wrong of you, though."</p>

<p>"What! wrong to make you look pretty!"</p>

<p>And she could not refrain from kissing him.</p>

<p>"What would mother say?"</p>

<p>"She's out."</p>

<p>"But if she came in?"</p>

<p>"She won't."</p>

<p>"Well, at any rate, I shall have to go and put it up."</p>

<p>"No, please don't."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>"But suppose someone comes in?"</p>

<p>"They won't. And besides, if they did, they ought
to think themselves jolly lucky; you look simply
lovely!"</p>

<p>"Do I?" The words came in a soft whisper from
lips almost touching his.</p>

<p>"As always." The hand that lay in his pressed
tightly. "You'll stay like that, won't you?"</p>

<p>"If you're good."</p>

<p>"Darling!"</p>

<p>He did not tell her about the dinner. He suggested
that he should call for her at six, and she was too
excited at the time to take into account so material a
consideration as food. But her eyes sparkled with
pleasure when he took her into the little Soho restaurant
where he had booked a table. She had never been in
such a place before and her delight in the unfamiliar
room and food was joy to Roland. For her it was a
place of mystery and enchantment. She asked him
hurried, excited questions: What sort of people
came here? Did he think the lady in the corner was
an actress? Who had painted the brightly coloured
fresco? He persuaded her to take half-a-glass of wine;
she sipped at it in a fascinating, nervous manner,
with little pecks, as though she thought it were going
to burn her, and between each sip she would smile at
Roland over the rim of the wine-glass. As she sat she
flung to left and right quick, eager glances at the waiter,
the hangings, the occupants of the other tables. Her
excitement charmed Roland. It was like seeing a
child play with a new toy. In a way, too, it was an
excitant to his vanity, a tribute to his manhood, to his
superior knowledge of the world. And in the theatre,
when the light was turned out, he sat close to her and
held her hand tightly at the moments of dramatic
tension; and when she marvelled at the beauty of the
heroine he whispered in her ear: "Nothing like as
pretty as you are!" And Mrs Whately, sitting on the
other side of Roland, glanced at them from time to
time with a kind indulgence, remembering her youth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
and her early love-making. It was a memorably happy
evening. When Roland walked back with April and
kissed her good-night in the doorway she said nothing,
but her hand clenched tightly on the lapel of his coat.
And when he returned home he saw in his mother's eye
an expression of love and gratitude that had not been
there for a long while.</p>

<p>He walked upstairs in a mood of deep contentment.
After he had undressed he stood for a moment at the
open window, looking out over the roofs and chimney-stacks
of London. Behind a few window-panes glowed
the faint light of a candle or a lamp, but the majority
of the houses were obscured in darkness. Hammerton
was asleep. But the confused murmur of traffic and
the faint red glow in the sky reminded him that the true
London, the London that he loved, was only now waking
to a night of pleasure. Ah, well, to-morrow he would
be at Hogstead. He flung back his arms with the
proud relief of one who has fulfilled his obligations and
is at liberty to take his own enjoyment.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a></h3>

<p class="subtitle">LILITH AND MURIEL</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Roland</span> was in the true holiday mood as he
stepped into the afternoon train to Hogstead.
He had before him the prospect of sixty
hours of real happiness. He would be made much
of, he would be congratulated, he would be able, on
occasions, to lead the conversation. It was no small
feat that he had accomplished. He had won the
appreciation of a family that was satisfied with itself
and was inclined to regard its own achievements as the
summit of human ability and ambition. It had been
simple in comparison to make an impression on April&mdash;a
dinner in a Soho restaurant. Muriel and Beatrice
would have accepted such an evening as a matter of
course, an affair of everyday occurrence. His heart
beat quickly as he thought of Beatrice. Would she
be there, he wondered. Would she have heard of his
success? What effect would it have made on her?
She might regard it as much or little. One never knew.
Muriel, though, had been impressed; that he knew for
certain. It would be great fun receiving her congratulations.
He thought of her as he had left her four months
ago, a tousle-headed Muriel, a little girl who had charmed
him with her chatter and had been so unexpectedly
petulant when he had questioned her about her aunt.
He had not realised that at seventeen four months
make a big difference with a girl. No one had told him
that she had put her hair up and that her skirts would
only reveal the instep of her ankle. He had left her a
girl and she had become a woman.</p>

<p>She was the first person he saw on his arrival. A
footman had just taken his bag and was helping him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
off with his coat when the drawing-room door opened,
there was a rustle of skirts, and Muriel came impulsively
to greet him.</p>

<p>He drew back in surprise at the sight of her tall,
graceful figure, with the long, tightly fitting skirt and
hair no longer tossing mischievously about her shoulders,
but gathered behind her neck in a long, wide curve.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Roland?" she asked.</p>

<p>"But, Muriel," he said.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"You are so changed."</p>

<p>She broke into a peal, a silvery peal, of laughter.</p>

<p>"So you have noticed it? We wondered whether
you would. Mother thought you would, but I said you
wouldn't. And Gerald had a bet with father about it
and he's won, so he'll have to take us all to a theatre.
Come and tell them about it."</p>

<p>Roland followed her in amazement. The change in
her was so unexpected. He had always looked on her
as a little girl whom he had teased and played with,
and now, suddenly, in a night, she had grown up into a
daughter of that other world of which he had caught
fleeting, enticing glimpses at restaurants and theatres.
He watched her as she laughed and talked, unable to
realise that this was the little girl with whom he had
played last summer. And yet to him she was unaltered.
She offered him the same frank comradeship. She
took him for a walk after tea and spoke with real
enthusiasm of his success.</p>

<p>"I can't say how glad I am, Roland. I was so
awfully anxious for you to come off. I was so afraid
something might go wrong. I think it's wonderful of
you."</p>

<p>Her words thrilled him. It was something to win
the admiration of a girl like Muriel. April was naturally
impressed by his achievements. Of course it
would be wonderful to her that he should visit great
cities and dabble in high finance. It was like a fairy
story that had come true. But Muriel had spent all
her life in that world. She had travelled; her parents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
were rich. She was accustomed to the jargon of finance.
It would have been a feat for him, a newcomer to that
world, to have proved himself able to move comfortably
there, but to have impressed her with his achievements
... and when she began to ask him how he had
manœuvred those big interviews his flattered vanity
could not allow him to hold his secret.</p>

<p>"But I've told no one," he said, "not even my
people."</p>

<p>"That's all the more reason why you should tell me."</p>

<p>"Will you promise to keep it a secret?"</p>

<p>"On my honour."</p>

<p>And so he told her of his fortune and adroitness, how
he had met Monsieur Rocheville in the restaurant and
how he had tricked Herr Haupsehr with the magic
name of Brumenhein. She laughed heartily and asked
him questions. What would happen if the two ever
met?</p>

<p>"The Lord knows," said Roland. "But in the
meantime we shall have sold many gallons of varnish,
and perhaps we shall have become indispensable to the
old fellow."</p>

<p>They made no mention during their walk of Beatrice.
For some unexplained reason Roland had felt shy of
asking Muriel whether she was to be one of the party.
He had been content to wait and, on their return, he
experienced, as he pushed open the drawing-room door,
a sudden surprising anxiety. Would Beatrice be there?
He assumed composure, but he could not prevent his
eyes travelling quickly round the room in search of her.
When he saw that she was not there he felt a sudden
emptiness, a genuine disappointment. She would not
be coming, then. And now that she was not there half
his excitement, his enthusiasm, was gone. He sat
beside Mrs Marston and discussed, without interest, the
costliness of Brussels lace, and wondered how soon he
could conveniently go and change for dinner. The
minutes dragged by.</p>

<p>And then at last, in that half-hour when the room
was slowly emptying, the door opened and he saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Beatrice, her slim figure silhouetted against the dull
red wall-paper of the hall. His heart almost stopped
beating. Would she notice him, he wondered. Had
she forgotten their lunch together? Had the growing
intimacy between them been dispelled by a four
months' absence? He watched her walk slowly into
the room, her hair, as ever, disordered about her neck
and temples, and on her features that look of difference,
of being apart, of belonging to another world, that
appearance of complete detachment. Then suddenly
she saw Roland, and smiled and walked quickly forward,
her hand stretched out to him.</p>

<p>"I've been hearing so much about you," she said.
"They tell me you've been doing wonderful things. Come
and sit with me over here and tell me all about it."</p>

<p>And once again the love of vanity prompted him to
confess his secret.</p>

<p>"But you won't tell anyone, will you?" he implored.</p>

<p>She smiled. "If I can keep my own secrets, surely
I can keep yours," she said. Then, after a pause,
"And they tell me Gerald won his bet."</p>

<p>He blushed hotly. "Yes."</p>

<p>"I knew he would," she said, and she leant forward,
as she had at the restaurant, her hands pillowing her
chin, her eyes fixed on his.</p>

<p>Roland laughed nervously. "But I don't see
why," he began.</p>

<p>She shook her head. "That's the mistake all you
men make. You think a woman sees nothing unless
she's not watching you the whole time. But she does."</p>

<p>It flattered him to be included under the general
heading of "you men." And at that moment Muriel
came into the room. She was wearing a low evening
dress, wonderfully charming in her new-found womanhood.
Roland's eyes followed her in admiration.</p>

<p>"Isn't she pretty?" he said. "That pale blue
dress; it's just right. It goes well with her complexion.
Pale colours always do."</p>

<p>Beatrice did not answer for a moment; then she
gave a little sigh. "Yes, very pretty. I envy her."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>Roland turned quickly to her a look of surprised
interrogation.</p>

<p>"But you! Why, you look younger than any of us."</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders. "Perhaps; but what's
the use of it to me? Ah, don't say anything, please.
You mustn't waste your time on me. Go on and talk
to Muriel."</p>

<p>Dinner that evening was a jovial meal. Muriel
having announced with due solemnity that Gerald had
won his bet, she proceeded to decide at what theatre
Mr Marston should fulfil his obligation.</p>

<p>"And don't you think," said Muriel, "that Roland
ought to come with us? If it weren't for him we
shouldn't be going at all."</p>

<p>"I suppose he ought, the young rascal, though I
can't think why he should have spotted it. Muriel
was an untidy little scamp when he went away, and
she's an untidy little scamp now he's come back."</p>

<p>"Oh, father!"</p>

<p>"Yes, you are. You can't tell what's on purpose
with you and what isn't; you're all over the place."</p>

<p>It was perfectly untrue, of course, but they laughed
all the same.</p>

<p>"That's a poor excuse, father," said Gerald. "I
knew he'd spot it. It's through spotting things like
that that he manages to wangle interviews with all
these pots."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is, perhaps it is; I'm bothered if I know
how he does it." And Roland and Muriel exchanged
a swift glance of confederacy: a feeling that was increased
when the last post arrived and Mr Marston
interrupted the general conversation with a piece of
news his letter had brought him.</p>

<p>"My dear, here's a funny thing. I never saw it in
the papers, though I suppose it must have been in
them. But that fellow Brumenhein is dead."</p>

<p>"Brumenhein!"</p>

<p>"Yes, you know&mdash;the fellow whom the Kaiser
thought such a lot of. People said he might very likely
supplant Griegenbach."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>"I didn't dare look at you," Roland said to Muriel
afterwards. "I couldn't have kept a straight face if
I had."</p>

<p>"And what a bit of luck."</p>

<p>"It may save me a lot of unpleasantness later on."</p>

<p>"You're a wonderful boy."</p>

<p>They were saying good-night to each other on the
landing, and Muriel, who slept on the second floor, was
standing on the stairs, leaning over the banisters. Her
words made Roland feel very brave and confident.</p>

<p>"And to think that you didn't expect me to notice
that you had put your hair up!"</p>

<p>He meant it as a joking repartee to her compliment,
but the moment after he had said it he felt frightened.
They looked at each other and said nothing. There
was a moment of chill, intense embarrassment, then
Muriel gave a nervous laugh and, turning quickly, ran
up to her bedroom.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a></h3>

<p class="subtitle">THREE YEARS</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> next three years of Roland's life were an
amplification of those three days, and nothing
would be gained by a detailed description of
them. The narrative would be cut across frequently
by visits to Europe, dropped threads would have to be
gathered up, relationships reopened. The action was
delayed, interrupted and, at times, held up altogether.
The trips abroad were always altering Roland's perspective,
and the sense of distance made him reconsider
his attitude. Four months after the events described
in the last chapter he had reached a state of acute
reaction against his home, his parents and, in a way,
against April, because of her connection with that
world from which he was endeavouring to escape.
Very little was needed to drive him into declared revolt,
but at that moment he was sent abroad and, once
abroad, everything became different. He began to
accuse himself of selfishness and ingratitude. His
parents had denied themselves comfort and pleasure
to send him to an expensive school; they had given him
everything. Like the pelican, they had gone hungry so
that he should be full. Since he could remember, the
life of that family had centred round him. Every
question had been considered on the bearing it would
have on his career. Was this the manner of repayment?
And it was the same with April. He forgot
her mother and her home; he remembered only her
beauty and her love for him, her fixed, unwavering
love, and the dreams that they had shared. He always
returned home in a temper of sentimentality, full of
good resolutions, promising himself that he would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
gentle and sympathetic to his parents, that he would
never swerve from his love for April. The first days
were invariably soft and sweet: but in a short time
the old conflict reasserted itself; the bright world of
Hogstead stood in dazzling contrast to the unromantic
Hammerton. He became irritated, as before, by the
trifling inconveniences of a house that lacked a parlourmaid;
unpunctual, unappetising meals; and, more
especially, by the endless friction imposed on him by
the company of men and women who had been harassed
all their lives by the fret and worry of small houses and
small incomes. Trivial, ignoble troubles, that was the
misfortune of everyone fated to live in Hammerton.
And April was a part of it. He was very fond of her;
indeed, he still thought he was in love with her, but
love for Roland was dependent on many other things,
was bound up with his other enthusiasms and reactions.
He enjoyed her company and her caresses. In her
presence he was capable of genuine tenderness; but it
was so easy. April responded so simply to any kindness
shown to her. There was no uncertainty about
her. He missed the swift anger of the chase.</p>

<p>More and more frequently he found himself receiving
and accepting invitations to spend the week-end at
Hogstead; and always when he announced his intention
of going there he was aware of silent criticism on
the part of his parents. He felt guilty and ashamed of
himself for feeling guilty. It became a genuine struggle
for him to pronounce the words at breakfast. It was
like confessing a secret, and he hated it. Had he not
a right to choose his friends? Then would come a reaction
of acute self-accusation and he would improvise
a treat, a theatre or a picnic. His emotions would
fling it like a sop to his conscience: "There, does that
content you? Now may I go and live my own life?"
Afterwards, of course, he was again bitterly ashamed
of himself.</p>

<p>But always on the ebb-flow of his contrition came
fear&mdash;the instinct of self-preservation, to save, at all
costs, his individuality from the fate that threatened it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
Whenever things seemed likely to reach a head, a
European trip would intervene, and the whole business
would have to begin again. An action that would
ordinarily have completed its rhythm within three or
four months was lengthened into three years; in the
end inevitably the curve of the parabola was reached.
The time was drawing near when Roland would have to
make his decision one way or another.</p>

<p>He was by now earning a salary of four hundred
pounds a year, and marriage&mdash;marriage as his parents
understood it&mdash;was well within his means. Up till now,
whenever any suggestion about the date of his marriage
had been advanced, he referred to the uncertain nature
of his work.</p>

<p>"I never know where I'm going to be from one week
to another. Marriage is out of the question for a chap
with a job like that."</p>

<p>Their engagement was still unannounced. He had
retained that loophole, though at the time it was not so
that he had regarded it.</p>

<p>Ralph had asked him once whether he was engaged.
And the question had put him on his guard. He
didn't like engagements. Love was a secret between
two people. Why make it public? He must strike
before the enemy struck. In other words, he must
come to an agreement with April before her mother
opened negotiations. That evening he had brought
up the subject.</p>

<p>He was sitting in the window-seat, while she was on a
stool beside him, her head resting against his knees and
his hand stroking slowly her neck and hair and cheek.</p>

<p>"You know, darling," he said, "I've been thinking
about our engagement."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>"Well, are you awfully keen on an engagement?"</p>

<p>"But how do you mean? We shall have to be
engaged some time, shan't we?"</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, yes. But there's no need for a long
engagement, is there? What I mean is that we could
easily get engaged now if we wanted to. But it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
be a long business, and oh, I don't know! Once we're
engaged our affairs cease to be our own. People will
be asking us 'When's the happy day?' and all that
sort of thing. Our love won't be our own any longer."</p>

<p>"It's just as you like, dear."</p>

<p>It was so nice to sit there against his knee, with
his fingers against her face. Why should they worry
about things? It would be nice to be engaged, of
course, and to have a pretty ring, but it didn't matter.
"It's just as you like," she had said, and they had left
it at that over two years ago and there had been no
reason to rediscuss it. But he knew that now the
whole matter would have to be brought up. It had
been decided that he was to remain in London for a
couple of years in charge of the Continental branch;
he would have to go abroad occasionally, but there
would be no more long trips. He was in a position to
marry if he wanted to. His family would expect him
to, those of his friends who had heard of the "understanding"
would expect him to, Mrs Curtis would
expect him to, and he owed it to April that he should
marry her. For years now he had kept her waiting.
There was not the slightest doubt as to what was his
duty.</p>

<p>Nothing, however, could alter the fact that there was
nothing in the world that he wanted less than this
marriage. It would mean an end to all those pleasant
week-ends at Hogstead. It was one thing to invite a
young bachelor who was no trouble to look after and
who was amusing company; it was quite another
thing to entertain a married couple. He would no
longer be able to throw into his business that undivided
energy of his. He would not be free; he would have
to play for safety. As his friendship with the Marstons
began to wane, he would become increasingly every
year an employee and not an associate. He would
belong to the ruled class. And it would be the end, too,
of his pleasant little dinner-parties with Gerald. He
would have to be very careful with his money. They
would be fairly comfortable in a small house for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
first year or so, but from the birth of their first child
their life would become complicated with endless
financial worries and would begin to resemble that of
his own father and mother, till, finally, he would lose
interest in himself and begin to live in his children.
What a world! The failure of the parent became forgotten
in the high promise of the child, and that child
grew up only to meet and be broken by the conspiracy
of the world's wisdom and, in its turn, to focus its
thwarted ambitions on its children, and then its
children's children. That was the eternal cycle of
disillusion; whatever happened he must break that
wheel.</p>

<p>But the battle appeared hopeless. The forces were
so strong that were marshalled against him. What
chance did he stand against that mingled appeal of
sentiment and habit? All that spring he felt himself
standing upon a rapidly crumbling wall. Whenever
he went down to Hogstead he kept saying to himself:
"Yes, I'm safe now, secure within time and space.
But it's coming. Nothing can stop it. Night follows
day, winter summer; one can't fight against the future,
one can't anticipate it. One has to wait; it chooses
its own time and its own place." At the office he was
fretful and absent-minded.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you?" Gerald asked him
once.</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"Oh, but there must be, you've been awfully queer
the last week or so."</p>

<p>Roland did not answer, and there was an awkward
silence.</p>

<p>"I say, old man, I don't quite like asking you, but
you're not in debt or anything, are you? Because if
you are, I mean&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, really. I'm not even 'overdrawn.'"</p>

<p>In Gerald's experience of the world there were two
ills to which mankind was heir&mdash;money and woman.
The subdivisions of these ills were many, but he recognised
no other main source. If Roland was not in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
debt, then there was a woman somewhere, and later in
the day he brought the matter up again.</p>

<p>"I say, old son, you've not been making an ass of
yourself with some woman, have you? No one's got
hold of you, have they?"</p>

<p>"Lord, no!" laughed Roland. "I only wish they
had!"</p>

<p>But Gerald raised a warning finger.</p>

<p>"Touch wood, my son. Don't insult Providence.
You can take my word for it that sooner or later some
woman will get hold of you and then it's the devil, the
very devil. Did I ever tell you about the girl at Broadstairs?"
And there ensued the description of a seaside
amour, followed by some shrewd generalities on the
ways of a man with&mdash;but to conclude the quotation
would be hardly pertinent. At any rate, Gerald told
his story and pointed his moral.</p>

<p>"You may take my word for it, adultery is a whacking
risk. It's awfully jolly while it lasts, and you think
yourself no end of a dog when you offer the husband
a cigar, but sooner or later the wife clings round the
bed-post and says: 'Darling, I have deceived you!'
And then you're in it, up to the ruddy neck!"</p>

<p>Roland laughed, as he always did, at Gerald's stories,
but it hurt him to think that his friend should have
noticed a change in him. If he was altered already by
a few weeks of Hammerton, what would he be like in
five years' time after the responsibilities of marriage
had had their way with him? And marriage was not
for five years, but for fifty.</p>

<p>He never spoke to Gerald of April now. There had
been a time in the early days of their friendship when
he had confided in him, under an oath of secrecy, that
he hoped to marry her as soon as his position permitted.
And Gerald had agreed with him that it was a fine
thing to marry young, "and it's the right thing for
you," he added; "some fellows are meant for marriage
and others aren't. I think you're one of the ones that
are." A cryptic statement that Roland had, at the
time, called in question, but Gerald only laughed. "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
may be wrong," he had said, "one never knows, but I
don't think I am." Often afterwards he had asked
Roland about April and whether they were still in love
with each other as much as ever, and Roland, his vanity
flattered by the inquiry, had assured him of their constancy.
But of late, when Gerald had made some
light reference to "the fair April," Roland had changed
the conversation, or, if a question were asked, had
answered it obliquely, or managed to evade it, so that
Gerald had realised that the subject was no longer
agreeable to him, and, being blessed with an absence
of curiosity, had dropped it from his repertoire of
pleasantries. But he did not connect April with his
friend's despondency.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h3>

<p class="subtitle">THREE DAYS</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> summer was nearly over, however, before
the crisis came. It was on a Friday evening
in the beginning of September, and Roland was
sitting with his mother, as was usual with them, for a
short talk after his father had gone to bed. He could
tell that something was worrying her. Her conversation
had been disjointed and many of her remarks
irrelevant. And suddenly his instinct warned him that
she was going to speak to him about April. He went
suddenly still. If someone had thrown a stone at him
at that moment he would have been unable to move
out of the way of it. He could recollect distinctly, to
the end of his life, everything that had passed through
his mind during that minute of terrifying silence that
lay between his realisation of what was coming and the
first sound of that opening sentence.</p>

<p>"Roland, dear, I hope you won't mind my mentioning
it, but your father and I have been talking together
about you and April."</p>

<p>He could remember everything: the shout of a newsboy
in the street&mdash;"Murder in Tufnell Park!" the
slight rustle of the curtain against the window-sill; the
click of his mother's knitting-needles. And, till that
moment, he had never noticed that the pattern of the
carpet was irregular, that on the left side there were
seven roses and five poppies and on the right six roses
and six poppies. They had had that carpet for twenty
years and he had never noticed it before. His eyes
were riveted on this curious deformity, while through
the window came the shriek of the newsboy&mdash;"Murder
in Tufnell Park!" Then his mother's voice broke the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
tension. The moment had come; he gathered his
strength to him. As he had walked five years earlier,
with unflinching head, up the hill to Carus Evans, so
now he answered his mother with an even voice:</p>

<p>"Yes, mother?"</p>

<p>"Well, dear, we've been thinking that you really
ought to be settling something definite about yourself
and April."</p>

<p>"But we didn't want to be engaged, mother."</p>

<p>"I wasn't thinking of that, dear. I know about
that. It's a modern idea, I suppose, though I think
myself that it would have been better some time ago,
but it's not an engagement so much we're thinking of
as of your marriage."</p>

<p>It was more sudden than Roland had expected.</p>

<p>"Oh, but&mdash;oh, surely Mrs Curtis would never agree.
She'd say we were much too young."</p>

<p>"Well, that's what we thought, but I went round and
saw her the other day, and she quite agreed with us
that it was really no good waiting any longer. You
are making a lot of money, and it's quite likely that
Mr Marston will raise your salary when he hears you're
going to be married; and after all, why should you
wait? As I said to your father: 'They've known
each other for a long time, and if they don't know their
minds now they never will.'"</p>

<p>Roland did not know what to say. He was unarmed
by a sympathy and kindness against which he could
not fight.</p>

<p>"It's awfully decent of you." Those were the only
words that occurred to him, and he knew, even as he
uttered them, that they were not only completely
inadequate, but pitifully inexpressive of his state of
mind.</p>

<p>"We only want to do what will make you happy,
and it is happier to marry young, really it is!"</p>

<p>He made a last struggle.</p>

<p>"But, mother, don't you think that for April's sake&mdash;she's
so young. Isn't it rather hard on her to be
loaded with responsibilities so early?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's nice of you to think that, Roland. It shows
you really care for her; but I think that in the end, when
she's an old woman like I am, she'll be glad she married
young."</p>

<p>And then, because Roland looked still doubtful, she
offered him the benefit of what wisdom the narrow
experiences of her life had brought her. She had never
unlocked her heart before; it hurt her to do it now and
her eyes welled with tears. But she felt that, at this
great crisis of his life, she must be prepared to lay
before her son everything that might help him in it.
It might be of assistance to him to know how these
things touched a woman, and so she told him how she
too had once thought it cruel that responsibilities
should have been laid on her so soon.</p>

<p>"I was only nineteen when I married your father,
and things were very difficult at first. It was a small
house, we had no servant, and I had to get up early in
the morning and light the fires and get the breakfast
things ready, and all the morning I had to scrub and
brush and wash up. I had no friends. And then, after
tea, I used to lie down for an hour and rest, I was so
tired, and I wanted to look fresh and pretty for your
father when he came home. And there were times
when I thought it was unfair; that I should have been
allowed to be free and happy and unworried like other
girls of my age. I used to see some of my school friends
very occasionally and they used to tell me of their balls
and parties, and I was so envious. And then very often
your father was irritable and bad-tempered when he
came back, and he found fault with my cooking, and I
used to go away and cry all by myself and wonder why
I was doing it, working so hard and for nothing. And
then I began to think he didn't love me any more;
there was another girl: she was fresher; she didn't
have to do any housework. There was nothing in it;
it never came to anything. Your father was always
faithful; he's always been very good to me, but I could
see from the way his face lighted up when she came
into the room that he was attracted by her, and I can't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
tell you how it hurt me. I used to think that he
preferred that other girl, that he thought her prettier
than I was. It wasn't easy those first three years.
When you've been married three years you're almost
certain to regret it and think you could have done better
with someone else, but after ten years you'll know very
well that you couldn't, because, Roland, love doesn't
last; not what you mean by love; but something takes
its place, and that something is more important.
When two people have been through as much together
as your father and I have, there's&mdash;I don't know how
to put it&mdash;but, you can't do without each other. And
it makes a big difference the being married early.
That's why I should like you and April to marry as soon
as ever you can. You'd never regret it."</p>

<p>The tears began to trickle slowly down her cheeks;
she tried to go on, but failed.</p>

<p>Roland did not know what to do or say. He had
never loved his mother so much as he did then, but he
could not express that love for her with words. He
knelt forward and put his arms round her and drew
her damp cheek to his.</p>

<p>"Mother," he whispered. "Mother, darling!"</p>

<p>For a long time they remained thus in a silent embrace.
Then she drew back, straightened herself, and
began to dab at her eyes with a handkerchief.</p>

<p>"It'll be all right, mother," he said.</p>

<p>She did not answer, but smiled a soft, glad smile, and
taking his hand pressed it gently between hers.</p>

<p>"As long as you're happy, Roland," she said.</p>

<p>And so the crisis had come and had been settled.
In those few minutes the direction of fifty years had
been chosen finally. It was hard, but what would you?
Life went that way. At any rate he would have those
first few scented months; that at least was his. For
a year he and April would be indescribably happy in
the new-found intimacy of marriage, and afterwards&mdash;but
of what could one be certain? For all he knew life
might choose to readjust itself. One could not have
anything both ways; indeed, one paid for everything.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
The Athenian parent had been far-seeing when he
knelt before the altar in prayer that the compensating
evil for his son's success might be light. One should
do what lay to hand. As he curled himself in his bed
he thought of April, and his heart beat quickly at the
knowledge that her grace and tenderness would soon
be his.</p>

<p>He shut away all thought of the dark years that must
follow the passing of that first enchantment and fixed
his mind on the sure pleasures that awaited him. How
wonderful, after all, marriage could be. To return
home at the end of the day and find your wife waiting
for you. You would be tired and she would take you
in her arms and run cool fingers through your hair, and
you would talk together for a while, and she would tell
you what she had done during the day, and you would
tell her of whom you had met and of the business you
had transacted, and you would bring your successes
and lay them at her feet and you would say: "I made
so much money to-day." And your words would lock
that money away in her little hand&mdash;"All yours,"
they would seem to say. Then you would go upstairs
and change for dinner, and when you came down you
would find her standing before the fire, one long, bare
arm lying along the mantelpiece, and you would come
to her and very slowly pass your hand along it, and,
bending your head, you would kiss the smooth skin of
her neck. And could anything be more delightful
than the quiet dinner together? Then would come the
slow contentment of that hour or so before bedtime,
while the warmth of the fire subsided slowly and you
sat talking in low tones. And, afterwards, when you
were alone in the warm darkness to love each other.
Marriage must be a very fine adventure.</p>

<p>The next day brought with it its own problems, and
on this Saturday morning in early autumn the white mist
that lay over the roofs of Hammerton was a sufficient
object of speculation. Did it veil the blue sky that
adds so much to the charm of cricket, or a grey, sodden
expanse of windy, low-flying clouds. It was the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
Saturday of the cricket season. Roland was, naturally,
bound for Hogstead, and there is no day in the whole
year on which the cricketer watches the sky with more
anxiety. In May he is impatient for his first innings,
but as he walks up and down the pavilion in his spiked
boots and hears the rain patter on the corrugated iron
roof he can comfort himself with the knowledge that
sooner or later the sun will shine, if not this week, then
the next, and that in a long season he is bound to have
many opportunities of employing that late cut he has
been practising so assiduously at the nets. In the
middle of the season he is a hardened warrior; he takes
the bad with the good; he has outgrown his first eagerness;
he has become, in fact, a philosopher. Last
week he made seventy-two against the Stoics and was
missed in the slips before he had scored. Such fortune
is bound to be followed by a few disappointments.
But at the end of the season a wet day is a dire misfortune.
As he sits in the pavilion and watches the
rain sweep across the pitch he remembers that only that
morning he observed the erection of goal posts on the
village green, that the winter is long and slow to pass,
that for eight months he will not hold a bat in his
hands, that this, his last forlorn opportunity of making
a century, is even now fast slipping from him.</p>

<p>The depression of such a day is an abiding memory
through the grey months of January and December,
and, though Roland had had a fairly successful season,
he was naturally anxious to end it well. He was prepared
to distrust that mist. He had seen many mists
break into heavy sunshine. He had also seen many
mists dissolve into heavy rain. He knew no peace
of mind till the sky began to lighten just before the
train reached Hogstead, and he did not feel secure till
he had changed into flannels and was walking down to
the field on Gerald's arm, their shadows flung hard and
black upon the grass in front of them.</p>

<p>It was a delightful morning; the grass was fresh with
the dew which a slight breeze was drying; there was
hardly a worn spot on the green surface, against which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
the white creases and yellow stumps stood in vivid
contrast. An occasional cloud cut the sunlight, sending
its shadow in long ripples of smoke across the field.</p>

<p>"And to think," said Gerald, "that this is our last
game this season."</p>

<p>But for Roland this certainty marred the enjoyment
of the blue sky and the bright sunshine. "This is the
last time," he repeated to himself. For eight months
the green field, so gay now with the white figures moving
in the sunlight, would be desolate. Leaves would
be blown on to it from the trees; rain would fall on
them. The windows of the pavilion would be barred,
the white screens stacked in the shelter of a wall.</p>

<p>After his innings he sat beside Muriel in the deck-chair
on the shaded, northern terrace. But he felt too
sad to talk to her and she complained of his silence.</p>

<p>"I don't think much of you as a companion," she
said. "I've timed you. You haven't said a word for
ten minutes."</p>

<p>He laughed, apologised and endeavoured to revert
to the simple badinage that had amused them when
Muriel was a little girl in short frocks, with her hair
blowing about her neck, but it was not particularly
successful, and it was a relief when Gerald placed his
chair on the other side of Muriel and commenced a
running commentary on the game. Roland wanted to
be alone with his thoughts. Occasionally a stray phrase
or sentence of their conversation percolated through
his reverie.</p>

<p>"What a glorious afternoon it's going to be," he
heard Muriel say. "It seems quite absurd that this
should be your last game. One can't believe that the
summer's over. On a day like this it looks as though
it would last for ever!"</p>

<p>The words beat themselves into his brain. It was
over and it was absurd to dream. The autumn sunshine
that had lured her into disbelief of the approach
of winter had made him forget that this day at Hogstead
was his last. By next year he would be married; the
delightful interlude would be finished. He would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
passed from the life of Hogstead, at any rate in his
present position. If he returned it would be different.
The continuity would have been broken.</p>

<p>Out of the corner of his eye he caught a glimpse of
Muriel's profile; how pretty she was; quite a woman
now; and he turned his chair a little so that he could
observe her without moving his head. Yes, she was
really pretty in her delicate porcelain fashion; she
was not beautiful. But, then, beauty was too austere.
Charm was preferable. And she had that charm that
depends almost entirely on its setting, on a dress that
is in keeping with small dainty features. The least
little thing wrong and she would have been quite
ordinary.</p>

<p>What would happen to her? She would marry, of
course; she would find no lack of suitors. Already,
perhaps, there was one whom she had begun slightly
to favour. What would he be like? To what sort of
a man would she be attracted? Whoever he was he
would be a lucky fellow; and Roland paused to wonder
whether, if things had been different, if he had been
free when he had met her first, she could have come
to care for him. She had always liked him. He remembered
many little occasions on which she had said
things that he might have construed into a meaning
favourable to himself. There had been that evening
on the stairs when they had felt suddenly frightened
of each other, and since then, more than once, he had
fancied that they had stumbled in their anxiety to
make impersonal conversation.</p>

<p>How happy they would have been together. They
would have lived together at Hogstead all their lives,
a part of the Marston family. Hammerton would have
ceased to exist for him. They would have built themselves
a cottage on the edge of the estate; their
children would have passed their infancy among green
fields, within sound of cricket balls.</p>

<p>At the far end of the field, on the southern terrace,
Beatrice was sitting alone, watching Rosemary play a
few yards away from her. She must have been there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
during the greater part of the morning, but Roland had
not noticed her till she waved a hand to attract his
attention. He rose at once and walked across to her.
He felt that a talk with her would do him good.</p>

<p>They had seen a good deal of each other intermittently
during the past three years, and each talk
with her had been for Roland a step farther into the
heart of a mystery. Gradually they had come to talk in
shorthand, to read each other's thoughts without need
of the accepted medium of words, so that when in reply
to a complimentary remark about the fascination of her
hat she made a quiet shrug of her shoulders, he knew
that it was prompted by the wound of her wasted beauty.
And on that late summer morning, with its solemn
warning of decay, Roland felt brave enough to put to
her the question that he had long wished to ask.</p>

<p>"Why did you marry him?" he said.</p>

<p>His question necessitated no break in the rhythm of
her reverie. She answered him without pausing.</p>

<p>"I didn't know my own mind," she said. "I was
very young. I wasn't in love with anyone else. My
mother was keen on it. I gave way."</p>

<p>Beatrice spoke the truth. Her mother had honestly
believed the match to be to her daughter's advantage.
Her own life had been made difficult through lack of
money. She had always been worried by it, and she had
naturally come to regard money as more important than
the brief fluttering of emotion that had been the prelude
to the long, bitter struggle. It had seemed to her a
wonderful thing that her daughter should marry this
rich man. Herself had only been unhappy because she
had been poor; her daughter would be always rich.</p>

<p>"How did you meet him?" Roland asked.</p>

<p>"I was his secretary. Romantic, isn't it? The
poor girl marries the rich employer. Quite like the
story books." And her hands fluttered at her sides.</p>

<p>Roland sought for some word of sympathy, but he
was too appalled by the cruel waste of this young
woman's beauty, of her enormous potentialities flung
away on an ageing, withered man, who could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
appreciate them. Her next sentence held for him the
force of a prophetic utterance.</p>

<p>"When you marry, Roland," she said, "choose your
own wife. Don't let your parents dictate to you. It's
your affair."</p>

<p>As their eyes met it seemed to him that they were
victims of the same conspiracy.</p>

<p>"One can't believe that the summer is over on a day
like this. It looks as though it would last for ever!"
The words ran like a refrain among his thoughts all
the afternoon. He had a long outing. Hogstead had
imported for the final match talent that was considerable
but was not local. The doctor had persuaded a
friend to bring his son, a member of the Rugby XI.
It was discovered that an old blue was spending his
honeymoon in a farmhouse a few miles away and a
deputation had been dispatched to him; while, at the
last moment, the greengrocer had arranged a compromise
on a "to account rendered" bill with a professional
at the county ground. Hogstead was far too
strong for Mr Marston's side and all the afternoon
Roland chased terrific off drives towards the terraces.
The more tired he became the deeper grew his depression.
The sun sank slowly towards the long, low-lying bank
of cloud that stretched behind the roofs of the village;
the day was waning, his last day. Came that hour
of luminous calm, that last hour of sunlight when the
shadows lengthen and a chilling air drives old players
to the pavilion for their sweaters. Above the trees
Roland could see the roof of the house; the trees
swayed before its windows; the sunlight had caught
and had turned the brass weathercock to gold. Never
again, under the same conditions, would he see Hogstead
as he in the past had so often seen it, standing
above the trees, resplendent in the last glitter of sunset.
It was only five years ago that he had come here for
the first time, and yet into those five years had been
crowded a greater measure of happiness than he could
hope to find in the fifty years that were left him.</p>

<p>At the end of the day Mr Marston's eleven had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
half-an-hour's batting, during which Roland made one or
two big hits. But it was an anticlimax, and his innings
brought him little satisfaction. It was over now. He
walked back to the pavilion, and with dismal efficiency
collected his boots and bat and pads and packed them
into his bag. What would he be like when he came to
do that next? What would have happened to him
between then and now? He came out of the pavilion
to find Muriel standing on the step, waiting, presumably,
for her brother. The need for sympathy, for feminine
sympathy, overwhelmed him, and he asked her whether
she would come for a walk with him&mdash;only a short
stroll, just for a minute or two. She looked at him in
surprise.</p>

<p>"But it's so late, Roland," she said; "we'll have to
go and change for dinner in a minute."</p>

<p>"I know, I know, but just for a minute&mdash;do."</p>

<p>He was not ready yet for the general talk and laughter
of the drawing-room; he wanted a few minutes of
preparation.</p>

<p>"Do come," he said.</p>

<p>She nodded, and they turned and walked together
towards the end of the cricket ground. She did not
know why he should want her to come with him at such
an unusual time, but she could see that he was unhappy,
that he needed sympathy, and so, after a second's
hesitation, she passed, for the first time in her life, her
arm through his. He looked at her quickly, a look of
surprise and gratitude, and pressed her arm with his.
He said nothing, now that she was with him. He did
not feel any need of words; it was her presence he
wanted, and all that her presence meant to him. But
she, being ignorant of what was in his mind, was
embarrassed by his silence.</p>

<p>"That was a jolly knock of yours," she said at last.</p>

<p>"Oh! not bad, but in a second innings!"</p>

<p>"Rather like that one of yours five years ago."</p>

<p>"What! Do you remember that?"</p>

<p>"Of course; it was a great occasion."</p>

<p>"For me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>"And for us."</p>

<p>The past and the emotions of the past returned to
him with a startling vividness. He could recall every
moment of that day.</p>

<p>"I was so anxious to come off," he said. "You
know I was to have gone into a bank and Gerald brought
me down in the hope that your pater would take to
me. I was frightfully nervous."</p>

<p>"So was I."</p>

<p>"But you'd never seen me."</p>

<p>"No, but Gerald had talked to me about you, and I
thought it such rotten luck that a fellow like you should
have to go into a bank. There'd been a row, hadn't
there?"</p>

<p>They had reached the hedge that marked the boundary
for the Marston estate; there was a gate in it, and
they walked towards it. They stood for a moment, her
arm still in his, looking at the quiet village that lay
before them. Then Roland dropped her arm and leant
against the gate.</p>

<p>"Yes, there'd been a row," he said, "and everything
was going wrong, and I saw myself for the rest
of my life a clerk adding up figures in a bank."</p>

<p>He paused, realising the analogy between that day
and this. Then, as now, destiny had seemed to be
closing in on him, robbing him of freedom and the
chance to make of his life anything but a grey subservience.
He had evaded destiny then, but it had
caught him now. And he leant on the gate, hardly
seeing the labourers trudging up the village street,
talking in the porch of the public-house; their women
returning home with their purchases for Sunday's
dinner.</p>

<p>Again Muriel was oppressed by his silence.</p>

<p>"I remember Gerald telling us about it," she said,
"and I was excited to see what you'd be like."</p>

<p>"And what did you think of me when you saw me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I was a little girl then"; she laughed nervously,
for his eyes were fixed on her face and she felt
that she was blushing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, but what did you think?" he repeated; "tell
me."</p>

<p>Her fingers plucked nervously at her skirt; she felt
frightened, and it was absurd to be frightened with
Roland, one of her oldest friends.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's silly! I was only a little girl then. What
does it matter what I thought? As a matter of fact,"
and she flung out the end of her confession carelessly,
as though it meant nothing, "as a matter of fact, I
thought you were the most wonderful boy I'd ever
seen." And she tried to laugh a natural, offhand
laugh that would make an end of this absurd situation,
but the laugh caught in her throat, and she went
suddenly still, her eyes fixed on Roland's. They
looked at each other and read fear in the other's eyes,
but in Roland's eyes fear was mingled with a desperate
entreaty, a need, an overmastering need, of her. His
tongue seemed too big for his mouth, and when at last
he spoke, his voice was dry.</p>

<p>"And what do you think of me now?"</p>

<p>She could say nothing. She stood still, held by the
grey eyes that never wavered.</p>

<p>"What do you think of me now?" he repeated.</p>

<p>She made a movement to break the tension, a swift
gesture with her hand that was intended for a dismissal,
but he was standing so close that her hand
brushed against him; she gave a little gasp as his hand
closed over it and held it.</p>

<p>"You won't tell me," he said. "But shall I tell
you what I thought of you then? Shall I tell you? I
thought you were the prettiest girl I had ever seen, and
I thought how beautiful you would be when you grew
up."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be so silly, Roland," and she laughed a
short, nervous laugh, and tried to draw her hand from
his, but he held it firmly, and drew her a little nearer
to him, so that he could take her other hand in his.
They stood close together, then she raised her face
slowly to his and the puzzled, wistful, trusting expression
released the flood of sentiment that had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
surging within him all the afternoon. His misery was
no longer master of itself, and her beauty drew to it the
mingled tenderness, hesitation, disappointment of his
vexed spirit. She was for him in that moment the
composite vision of all he prized most highly in life, of
romance, mystery, adventure.</p>

<p>His hands closed upon hers tightly, desperately, as
though he would rivet himself to the one thing of which
he could be certain, and his confused intense emotion
poured forth in a stream of eager avowal:</p>

<p>"But I never thought, Muriel, that you would be
anything like what you are; you are wonderful,
Muriel; I've been realising it slowly every day. I've
said to myself that we were only friends, just friends,
but I've known it was more than friendship. I've told
myself not to be silly, that you could never care for me&mdash;well,
I've never realised, not properly, not till this
afternoon, Muriel."</p>

<p>She was no longer frightened; his words had soothed
her, caressed her, wooed her; and when he paused, the
expression of her eyes was fearless.</p>

<p>"Yes, Roland," she said.</p>

<p>"Muriel, Muriel, I love you; I want you to marry
me. Will you?"</p>

<p>She blushed prettily. "But, Roland, you know; if
father and mother say yes, of course."</p>

<p>In the sudden release of feeling he was uncertain
what exactly was expected of a person whose proposal
had been accepted. They were on the brink of another
embarrassed silence, but Muriel saved them.</p>

<p>"Roland," she said, "you're hurting my fingers
awfully!"</p>

<p>With a laugh he dropped her hands, and that laugh
restored them to their former intimacy.</p>

<p>"Oh, Roland," she said, "what fun we shall have
when we are married."</p>

<p>He asked whether she thought her parents would be
pleased, and she was certain that they would.</p>

<p>"They like you so much." Then she insisted on his
telling when and how he had first discovered that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
in love with her. "Come along; let's sit on the gate
and you shall tell me all about it. Now, when was the
first time, the very first time, that you thought you were
in love with me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, but I don't know."</p>

<p>"Yes, you do; you must, of course you must, or
you'd be nothing of a lover. Come on, or I shall take
back my promise."</p>

<p>"Well, then, that evening on the stairs."</p>

<p>Muriel pouted.</p>

<p>"Oh, then!"</p>

<p>"Do you remember it?" he said.</p>

<p>"Of course I do. You frightened me."</p>

<p>"I know, and that's why I thought that one day you
might marry me."</p>

<p>"Oh, but how silly!" she protested. "I wasn't a
bit in love with you then. In fact, I was very annoyed
with you."</p>

<p>"And, besides, I think I've always been in love with
you."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, you haven't."</p>

<p>"Don't be too sure. And you?"</p>

<p>She smiled prettily.</p>

<p>"I've often thought what a nice husband you would
make."</p>

<p>And then she had taken his hand in her lap and
played with it.</p>

<p>"And where shall we live when we are married?"
he had asked her, and she had said she did not care.</p>

<p>"Anywhere, as long as there are lots of people to
amuse me."</p>

<p>She sat there on the gate, her light hair blowing under
the wide brim of her hat, laughing down at him, her
face bright with happiness. She was so small, so
graceful. Light as heatherdown, she would run a gay
motif through the solemn movement of his career.</p>

<p>"You are like a fairy," he said, "like a mischievous
little elf. I think I shall call you that&mdash;Elfkin."</p>

<p>"Oh, what a pretty name, Roland&mdash;Elfkin! How
sweet of you!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>They talked so eagerly together of the brilliant
future that awaited them that they quite forgot the
lateness of the hour, till they heard across the evening
the dull boom of the dinner gong. They both gasped
and looked at each other as confederates in guilt.</p>

<p>"Heavens!" she said, "what a start. We've got
to run!"</p>

<p>It was the nearest approach to a dramatic entrance
that Roland ever achieved. Muriel kept level with
him during the race across the cricket ground, but she
began to fall behind as they reached the long terrace
between the rhododendrons.</p>

<p>"Take hold of my hand," said Roland, and he
dragged her over the remaining thirty yards. They
rushed through the big French windows of the drawing-room
at the very moment that the party had assembled
there before going down to dinner. They had quite
forgotten that there would be an audience. They
stopped, and Muriel gave out a horrified gasp of "Oh!"</p>

<p>They certainly were a ridiculous couple as they stood
there hand in hand, hot, dishevelled, out of breath,
beside that well-groomed company of men and women
in evening dress. Mrs Marston hurried forward with
the slightly deprecating manner of the hostess whose
plans have been disturbed,</p>

<p>"My dear children&mdash;&mdash;" But Muriel had by this
time recovered her breath and courage. She raised a
peremptory hand.</p>

<p>"One minute. We've got something to tell you all."</p>

<p>"But surely, dear, after dinner," Mrs Marston began.</p>

<p>"No, mother, dear, now," and, with a twinkle in her
eye and a sly glance at her embarrassed lover, Muriel
made her alarming announcement:</p>

<p>"Roland and I, mother, we're going to be married."</p>

<p>Roland had seen in a French novel a startling incident
of domestic revelation recorded by two words: <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">consternation
générale</i>, and those two words suited the
terrible hush that followed Muriel's confession. It
was not a hush of anger, or disapproval, but of utter
and complete astonishment. For a few minutes no one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
said anything. The young men of the party either
adjusted their collar studs and gazed towards the
ceiling, or flicked a speck of dust from their trousers
and gazed upon the floor. The young women gazed
upon each other. Mrs Marston thought nervously of
the condition of the retarded dinner, and Mr Marston
tried, without success, to prove adequate to the situation.
Only Muriel enjoyed it; she loved a rag, and her
eyes passed from one figure to another; not one of them
dared look at her.</p>

<p>"Well," she said at last, "we did think you'd want
to congratulate us." To Mr Marston some criticism
of himself appeared to be implied in this remark. He
pulled down his waistcoat, coughed, and went through
the preliminaries usual to him when preparing to
address the board. And, in a sense, this was a board
meeting, a family board meeting.</p>

<p>"My dear Muriel," he began, but he had advanced
no further than these three words when the dinner
gong sounded for the second time. It was a signal for
Mrs Marston to bustle forward.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, but the dinner'll be getting quite cold if
we don't go in at once. Don't trouble to change, Mr
Whately, please don't; but, Muriel, you must go up
and do your hair, and if you have time change your
frock."</p>

<p>"Weren't they lovely?" said Muriel, as she and
Roland ran upstairs to wash. "I could have died with
laughter."</p>

<p>"You made me feel a pretty complete fool," said
Roland.</p>

<p>"Well, you made me feel very silly about three-quarters
of an hour ago. I deserved a revenge." And
she scampered upstairs ahead of him.</p>

<p>Roland washed quickly and waited for her at the foot
of the stairs. He was much too shy to go in alone.</p>

<p>"And they say that women are cowards," said Muriel,
when he confessed it to her. "Come along."</p>

<p>The quarter of an hour that had elapsed since the
sensational disclosure had given the company time to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
recover its balance, and when Muriel and Roland
entered the room, they found that two empty seats
were waiting for them side by side.</p>

<p>"Here they are," said Mr Marston, "and I hope that
they're thoroughly ashamed of themselves." He felt
himself again after a glass of sherry, and it was an
occasion of which a father should make the most.
It could only come once and he was prepared to enjoy
it to the full. "To think of it, my dear, the difference
between this generation and ours. Why, before I got
engaged to your mother, Muriel, why, even before I
began to court her, I went and asked her father's permission.
I can remember now how frightened I felt.
We respected our parents in those days. We always
asked their opinions first. But to-day&mdash;why, in you
burst, late for dinner, and announce with calm effrontery
that you're going to be married. Why, at this rate,
there won't be any engagements at all in a short time;
young people will just walk in at the front door and
say: 'We're married.'"</p>

<p>"Then we are engaged, father, aren't we?" said
Muriel.</p>

<p>"I didn't say so."</p>

<p>"Oh, but you did; didn't he, Roland?"</p>

<p>Roland was, however, too confused to hold any
opinion on the subject.</p>

<p>"Well, if you didn't actually say so you implied it.
At any rate we shall take it that you did."</p>

<p>"And that, I suppose, settles it?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>Mr Marston made a theatrical gesture of despair.</p>

<p>"These children!" he said.</p>

<p>It was a jolly evening. Roland and Muriel were the
centre of congratulations; their healths were drunk; he
was called on for a speech, and he fulfilled his duty amid
loud applause. Everyone was so pleased, so eager to
share their happiness. Beatrice turned to him a smile
of surprised congratulation. Only Gerald held back
from the general enthusiasm. Once across the table his
eyes met Roland's, and there was implied in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
glance a question. He was the only one of the party
who had heard of April, and never, in all their confidences,
had there passed between them one word that
might have hinted at a growing love between his sister
and his friend; it was this that surprised him. Surely
Roland would have told him something about it.
Roland was not the sort of fellow who kept things to
himself. He always wanted to share his pleasures.
Gerald would have indeed expected him to come to
him for advice, to say: "Old son, what chance do
you think I stand in that direction?"&mdash;to entrust
him with the delicate mission of sounding Muriel's
inclinations. He was surprised and a little hurt.</p>

<p>As they were going towards the drawing-room after
dinner he laid his hand on Roland's arm, holding him
back for a minute. And as he stood in the doorway
waiting for his friend, Roland felt for the first time a
twinge of apprehension as to the outcome of this undertaking.
But he could see that Gerald was nervous,
and this nervousness lent him confidence.</p>

<p>"It's no business of mine, old son," Gerald began,
"I'm awfully glad about you and Muriel and all that,
but," he paused irresolute; he disliked these theatrical
situations and did not know how to meet them. "I
mean," he began slowly, then added quietly, anxiously:
"It's all right, isn't it, old son?"</p>

<p>"Of course," said Roland. "It's the most
wonderful&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know, I know," Gerald interrupted, "but wasn't
there, didn't you tell me about&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's finished a long time ago. Don't worry
about that."</p>

<p>"You see," Gerald went on, "I should hate to
think&mdash;&mdash;Oh, well, I'm awfully glad about it, and
I think you're both fearfully lucky."</p>

<p>Two hours later Roland and Muriel stood on the
landing saying good-night to one another. She was
leaning towards him, across the banisters, as she had
leant that evening three years earlier, but this time he
held her hand in his.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can't tell you how happy I am," he was saying;
"I shall dream of you all night long."</p>

<p>"And so shall I of you."</p>

<p>"We're going to be wonderfully happy, aren't we?"</p>

<p>"Wonderfully."</p>

<p>And in each other's eyes they saw the eager, boundless
confidence of youth. They were going to make a
great thing of their life together. Roland cast a swift
glance over the banisters to see if anyone was in the
hall, then stood on tiptoe, raising himself till his face
was on the level with Muriel's.</p>

<p>"Muriel," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I want to whisper something in your ear."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Lean over, close to me, and I will tell you."</p>

<p>She bent her head, her cheek brushing against his
hair. "Well?" she said.</p>

<p>He placed his mouth close to her ear.</p>

<p>"Muriel, you haven't kissed me yet."</p>

<p>She drew back and smiled.</p>

<p>"Was that all?" she said.</p>

<p>"Isn't it enough?"</p>

<p>She made no answer.</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to?" he said.</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Please, please do."</p>

<p>"Some day I will."</p>

<p>"But why not now?"</p>

<p>"Someone would see us."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, they wouldn't. And even if they did what
would it matter? Muriel! please, please, Muriel!"</p>

<p>He raised himself again on tiptoe; and leaning forward,
she rested her hands upon his shoulders. Then
she slowly bent her head to his, and their lips met in
such a kiss as children exchange for forfeits in the
nursery. As she drew back Roland slipped back again
on to his heels, but he still held her hand and her fingers
closed round his, pressing them, if not with passion, at
least with fondness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>"You're rather an old dear, Roland," she said. And
there was a note in her voice that made him say quickly
and half audibly:</p>

<p>"And you're a darling."</p>

<p>She drew her hand from his gently. "And what was
that pretty name you called me?"</p>

<p>"Elfkin."</p>

<p>"Let me be always Elfkin."</p>

<p>Both of them that night were wooed to sleep by the
delight of their new-found happiness.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a></h3>

<p class="subtitle">THE LONELY UNICORN</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> lovers went for a walk together on Sunday
morning through the woods that lay beyond
the village, and they sat on a pile of broken
sticks that a charcoal burner had collected for a fire,
and they held hands and talked of the future. Her
pleasure in this new relationship was a continual
fascination to Roland. She regarded love, courtship
and marriage as a delightful game.</p>

<p>"What fun it's going to be," she said; "we shall
announce our engagement and then everyone will write
and congratulate us, and we shall have to answer them,
and I shall have to pretend to be so serious and say:
'I am much looking forward to introducing you to
my fiancé. I hope you will like each other.'"</p>

<p>"And what sort of a ring am I to get you?"</p>

<p>"The ring! Oh, I had forgotten that. One has to
have one, doesn't one? Let's see now. What should
I like?" And she paused, her finger raised to her
lower lip. She remained for a moment in perplexed
consideration, then suddenly shook her head.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't care, just what you like. Let it be
a surprise. But there's one thing, Roland, dear&mdash;promise
me."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You will promise, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Well, then, promise me you won't put any writing
inside it, because I shall want to show it to my friends
and I should feel so silly if they saw it."</p>

<p>After lunch Mr Marston asked him to come into the
study for a talk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm not going to play the heavy father," he said;
"in fact, you know yourself how thoroughly pleased
we are, both of us, about it all. We couldn't have
wished a better husband for Muriel. But there is such
a thing as finance, and you've got, I gather, no money
apart from what you earn from us."</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"And your salary now is&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Four hundred a year, sir."</p>

<p>"And how far do you think that will go? You
could start a home with it, of course, but do you think
you could make Muriel happy with it? She's a dainty
little lady, and when she's free from home authority
she will want to be going out to dances and theatres.
How far do you think four hundred will take her?"</p>

<p>"Not very far, sir."</p>

<p>"Then what do you propose to do? Long engagements
are a bad thing."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, then, what do you think of doing?"</p>

<p>Roland, who had expected Mr Marston to make his
daughter a generous dress allowance, was uncertain
how to answer this question. Indeed, he made no
attempt.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Mr Marston, "that what you were
really thinking was that I should make you some
allowance."</p>

<p>Roland blushed, and began to stammer that, as a
matter of fact, that was exactly what&mdash;but he never
finished the sentence, for Mr Marston interrupted him.</p>

<p>"Because, if that's what you were thinking, young
man, I can disillusion you at once. I don't believe in
allowances; they put a young couple under an obligation
to their parents. And that's bad. A young
couple should be independent. No!" he said, "I'm
not going to make Muriel any allowance, but," and
here he paused theatrically, so as to make the most of
his point, "I am going to give you a good opportunity
of making yourself independent. I am going to offer to
both you and Gerald junior partnerships in the business."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>Roland gave a start; he could scarcely believe what
he had heard.</p>

<p>"But, sir&mdash;&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"Yes, a partnership in our business, and I can't say
how pleased I shall be to have you there, and how proud
I am to have a son-in-law who will want to work and
not be content to attend an occasional board meeting
and draw large fees for doing so. I know a business
man when I meet one. We are jolly lucky to have got
you, and as for you and Muriel, well, honestly, I don't
know which of you is luckier!"</p>

<p>They were the same words that Gerald had used,
and he was convinced of their truth five minutes later
when he sat in the drawing-room pouring out this
exciting news to Muriel, when he saw her eyes light
with enthusiasm, and heard her say on a note of genuine
comradeship and admiration: "Roland, I always knew
it. You're a wonderful boy!"</p>

<p>This state of rapture lasted till he said good-night to
Gerald on Monday evening in the doorway of the office.
Then, and then only, did he realise to what a series
of complications he had delivered himself. He had
fallen into the habit of regarding his life at Hogstead
and his life at Hammerton as two separate entities;
what happened to him in one life did not affect him
in the other. Hogstead had been his dream country.
During the week-end he had retreated within his dream,
flung up bulwarks, garrisoned himself securely. He
had not realised that, when he returned to Hammerton,
he would have to deliver an account of himself. So far,
what had happened in that dream country had only
mattered to himself. His engagement to Muriel,
however, involved the fortunes of persons other than
himself, and this fact was presented to him acutely as
he sat on the top of a bus and drew nearer, minute by
minute, to No. 105 Hammerton Villas.</p>

<p>In the course of seventy-two hours he had completely
altered the direction of his life. He had left home on
Saturday morning with every intention of proposing definitely
to April at the first opportunity and of marrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
her as soon as the necessary arrangements could be
made. Yet here he was on Monday evening returning
home the fiancé of Muriel Marston and a junior partner
in her father's firm. He could not imagine in what
spirit the news would be received. His parents knew
little enough of Gerald and his father; they were hardly
aware of Muriel's existence. Years earlier he may have
said, perhaps, in reply to some casual query: "Oh,
yes, he's got a sister, much younger than himself, a
jolly kid!" But of late, nothing. He did not see
either how he was to introduce the subject. He would
be asked hardly any questions about his holiday; he
had always been uncommunicative.</p>

<p>"Have you had a nice time, my dear?"</p>

<p>That's what his mother would say, in the same
indifferent tone that she would say "Good morning,
how do you do?" to a casual acquaintance. She
would then proceed to tell him about the visitors they
had received on Sunday.</p>

<p>His father would arrive, lay down his evening paper
on the table and begin to change his boots.</p>

<p>"So you're back all right, Roland?" That would
be his only reference to his son's holidays before he
plunged into a commentary on the state of the bus
service, the country and the restaurant where he had
lunched.</p>

<p>"Coming for a walk, Roland?" That would be his
next indication that he was conscious of his son's
presence, and on the receipt of an affirmation he would
trudge upstairs, to reappear ten minutes later in a light
grey suit.</p>

<p>"Ready, my son?" And they would walk along
the High Street till they reached the corner of Upper
College Road. There Mr Whately would pause.
"Well, Roland, shall we go in and see April?" And
in reality the question would be an assertion. They
would have to go into the Curtises'; it would be terrible.
He would feel like Judas Iscariot at the Last Supper.
He would be received by Mrs Curtis as a future son-in-law.
April would smile on him as her betrothed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
Whatever he did or said he could not, in her eyes,
be anything but perfidious, disloyal, treacherous. He
would be unable to make clear to her the inevitable
nature of what had happened.</p>

<p>The red roofs and stucco fronts of Donnington had
by now receded into the distance; the bus was already
clattering down the main street of Lower Hammerton.
The lights in the shop windows had just been kindled
and lent a touch of wistful poetry to the spectacle of the
crowded pavements, black with the dark coats of men
returning from their offices, with here and there a splash
of gaiety from the dress of some harassed woman hurrying
to complete her shopping before her husband's
return.</p>

<p>"In three more minutes we shall be at the Town
Hall," Roland told himself. "In two minutes from
then I shall have reached the corner of Hammerton
Villas; 105 is the third house down on the left-hand
side. In six minutes, at the outside, I shall be
there!"</p>

<p>And it turned out exactly as he had predicted. He
found his mother in the drawing-room, turning the
handle of the sewing-machine. She smiled as he
opened the door and, as he bent his head to kiss her,
expressed the hope that he had enjoyed himself. Three
minutes later his father arrived.</p>

<p>"A most interesting murder case to-day, my dear;
there's a full account of it in <cite>The Globe</cite>. It appears
that the fellow was engaged to one girl, but was really
in love with the mother of the girl he murdered, and he
murdered the girl because she seemed to suspect&mdash;no,
that's not it. It was the girl he was engaged to who
suspected; but at any rate you'll find it all in <cite>The Globe</cite>&mdash;a
most interesting case." And he opened the paper
at the centre page and handed it to his wife. As he
did so his arm brushed against Roland, and the forcible
reminder of his son's existence inspired him to express
the hope that the cricket at Hogstead had reached the
high expectations that had been entertained regarding
it. This duty accomplished, he proceeded to describe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
in detail the lunch he had selected at the Spanish
café.</p>

<p>"There was a choice of three things: you could
either have <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors d'œuvre</i> or a soup, and then there
was either omelette or fish or spaghetti, with veal or
chicken or mutton to follow, and, of course, cheese
to finish up with. Well, I didn't think the spaghetti
at that place was very good, so I was left with a choice
of either an omelette or fish."</p>

<p>While he was stating and explaining his choice Mr
Whately had found time to divest his feet of his boots.</p>

<p>"Well, and what about a walk, Roland?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so, father."</p>

<p>"Right you are. I'll just run up and change."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, before Roland had had time to
unravel the complicated psychology of the Norfolk
murder case, Mr Whately was standing in the doorway
in his grey tweed suit and straw hat. "A bit late for
a straw, perhaps, but it's lovely weather, almost like
spring. One can't believe that summer's over." The
repetition of the phrase jarred Roland's conscience.
Would it not be better to get it off his chest now, once
and for all, before he was taken to see April, before that
final act of hypocrisy was forced on him?</p>

<p>"Father," he said, "there's something&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Mr Whately did not like to be kept waiting.</p>

<p>"Come along, Roland, time enough for that when
we are out of doors. It'll be dark soon."</p>

<p>And by the time they had reached the foot of the long
flight of steps the moment of desperate courage had
been followed by a desperate fear. Time enough when
he got back to tell them. He made no effort even to
discourage his father when, at the corner of Upper
College Road, they paused and the old assertive question
was asked. Roland nodded his head in meek
submission. What was to be gained at this point by
discussion? There would be enough turmoil later on.</p>

<p>But he regretted his weakness five minutes later when
he sat in the wicker chair by the window-seat. He
looked round the room at the unaltered furniture, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
unaltered pictures, the unaltered bookshelves, and
Mrs Curtis eternal in that setting, her voice droning on
as it had droned for him through so many years. There
was no change anywhere. Mrs Curtis was sitting
beside the fireplace, her knitting on her lap, the bones
of her body projecting as awkwardly as ever. His
father sat opposite her, his hat held forward before his
knees, his head nodding in satisfied agreement, his voice
interrupting occasionally the movement of his head
with a "Yes, Mrs Curtis," "Certainly, Mrs Curtis."
And he and April sat as of old, near and silent, in the
window-seat.</p>

<p>As he looked at April, the profile of her face silhouetted
against the window, an acute wave of sentiment
passed over him, reminding him of the many things
they had shared together. The first twenty years of
his life belonged to her. It was to her that he had
turned in his moment of success; her faith in him
had inspired his achievements. She had been proud
of him. He remembered how she had flushed with
pleasure when he had told her what the school captain
had said to him at the end of the season, and when he
had been invited to the cricket match at Hogstead it
was of her that he had asked soft encouragement, and
it was at her feet that he had laid, a few days later, his
triumph. How strange that was, that she should
have been the first to hear of Hogstead. The wave
of tenderness swept away every little difference of
environment and personality that had accumulated
round their love during the past three years. What a
fine thing, after all, they had meant to make of their
life together. What a confession of failure was this
parting. And when Mr Whately rose to go, and Mrs
Curtis followed him to the door, no doubt with the
intention of leaving the lovers alone together, Roland
put out his arms to April and folded her into them, and
for the last time laid his lips on hers in a kiss that expressed
for him an infinite kindness for her, and pity,
pity for her, for himself, and for the tangle life had
made of their ambitions. As he drew back his head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
from hers she whispered the word "Darling!" on a note
of authentic passion, but he could not say anything.
His hands closed on her shoulders for a moment,
then slackened. He could not bear to look at her. He
turned quickly and ran to his father. Was it, he asked
himself, the kiss of Iscariot? He did not know. He
had buried a part of himself; he had said good-bye to
the first twenty years of his life.</p>

<p>He walked home in silence beside his father. He
was in no mood for the strain of the exacting situation,
the astonishment, the implied reproach that lay in
front of him. But he was resigned to it. It had to
come; there was no loophole.</p>

<p>He made his announcement quite quietly during a
pause in the talk just after dinner. And it was received,
as he had anticipated, in a stupefied silence.</p>

<p>"What!" said Mr Whately at last. "Engaged to
Muriel Marston!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Muriel Marston, the daughter of my employer,
and I'm to become a junior partner in the firm."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;&mdash;" Mr Whately paused. He was not equal
to the pressure of the situation. He was not perplexed
by the ethics of Roland's action; his critical faculties
had only appreciated the first fact, that a plan had
been altered, and he was always thrown off his balance
by the alteration of any plan. He was accustomed
to thinking along grooves; he distrusted sidings. He
got no further than the initial "But." His wife, however,
had recovered from the shock and was by now
able to face the matter squarely. When she spoke her
voice was even.</p>

<p>"Now, please, Roland, we want to know all about
this. When did you propose to Miss Marston?"</p>

<p>"During the week-end&mdash;on Saturday evening."</p>

<p>"And her parents agree to it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said Roland, a little impatiently.
"Didn't I tell you that I've been offered a junior
partnership in his business."</p>

<p>"Of course; I forgot. I'm sorry. This is rather
difficult for us. Now, you say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>But at this point her husband, whose thoughts had
by now travelled a certain distance along the new
groove, interrupted her.</p>

<p>"But how can you talk about being engaged to this
Muriel Marston when you've been engaged for nearly
three years to April?"</p>

<p>Roland's retort came quickly.</p>

<p>"I've never been engaged to April."</p>

<p>"You know you have! Why!..."</p>

<p>But Mrs Whately had held up her hand.</p>

<p>"Hush, dear," she said. "Roland's quite right.
He's never been officially engaged to April."</p>

<p>Roland shivered at the venom that was revealed by
the stressing of the word "officially."</p>

<p>"And how long," she went on, "have you been in
love with Miss Marston?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know, mother; I can't tell. Please
let me alone." And there was genuine misery behind
the words. "One doesn't know about a thing like
this."</p>

<p>But Mrs Whately would not spare him. She shook
her head impatiently.</p>

<p>"Don't be absurd, Roland; you're behaving like
a child. Of course one knows these things. You've
known Miss Marston for four or five years now. You
couldn't suddenly find yourself in love with her."</p>

<p>"I suppose not, mother, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There's no 'but.' You must have been thinking
of her for a long time. On Friday night&mdash;Saturday
morning, I mean&mdash;you must have gone down there with
the full intention of proposing to her; didn't you?"</p>

<p>Roland did not answer her. He rose from his seat
and walked across to the window.</p>

<p>"It's no good," he said, and his back was turned to
them. "It's no good. I can't make you understand.
You won't believe what I say. I seem an awful beast
to you, I know, but&mdash;oh, well, things went that way."</p>

<p>And he stood there, looking out of the window
through the chink of the blind towards the long, grey
stretch of roofs, the bend of the road, the pools of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
lamplight, till suddenly, like a caress, he felt his
mother's hand upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Roland," she said, and for the first time there was
sympathy in her voice, "Roland, please tell me this.
You're not, are you, marrying this girl for her money?"</p>

<p>He turned and looked her full in the eyes.</p>

<p>"No, mother," he said, "I love Muriel Marston. I
love her and I want to marry her." As he spoke he saw
the kind light vanish from her eyes, her hand fell from his
shoulder and the voice that answered him was metallic.</p>

<p>"Very well, then, if that's so, there's no more to be
said. As you've arranged all this yourself, you'll let
us know when the marriage will take place."</p>

<p>She turned away. He took a step towards her.</p>

<p>"Mother, please&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But she only shrugged her shoulders, and when her
husband asked what was going to be done about April,
she said that she supposed that it was no affair of theirs,
and that no doubt Roland would make his own arrangements.
She picked up the paper and began to read it.
Roland wondered what was going to happen next;
the silence oppressed him. He listened to the slow
ticking of the clock till he could bear it no longer.</p>

<p>"Oh, please, one of you, won't you say something?"</p>

<p>They both turned their heads in surprise as though
they would survey a curiosity, a tortoise that had been
granted miraculously the gift of speech.</p>

<p>"But, my dear Roland, what is there to be said?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your mother's quite right," said Mr Whately.
"You're your own master; you've arranged to marry
the girl you want. What is there to be said?"</p>

<p>And their heads were again turned from him. He
stood looking at them, pondering the wisdom of an
appeal to their emotions. He half opened his mouth,
took a step forward, but paused; what purpose would
it serve? One could not appeal to stone; they were
hard, unreceptive, hostile; they would turn cold eyes
upon his outburst. He would look ridiculous. It
would do no good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, very well," he said, and walked out of the room.</p>

<p>As he sat on his bed that night he remembered how,
five years ago, he had returned to his study after that
tempestuous interview with the Chief and had reflected
on the impossibility of one mortal making clear his
meaning to another. Life went in a circle: here was
the same situation in a different setting. Everything
was repetition. Had not the Eastern critic laid it down
that in the whole range of literature there could be discovered
only seven different stories? He remembered
the Chief telling him that; it had stuck in his mind:
music had evolved from seven notes, painting from three
colours, literature from twenty-four letters, the chronicle
of mankind from seven stories. Variety, new clothes,
new accents, but at heart the same story, the same song.</p>

<p>One problem, however, that he had not previously
considered, had become clear for him during that
discussion. How was April to be told? He had
imagined that he had only to tell his parents for the
matter to be settled. They would do the rest. He had
never thought that the responsibility of breaking the
news to April would rest with him. And he could not
do it; it was no good pretending that he could.
He could no more tell April himself than he could
murder a man in cold blood. He knew also that if he
once saw her he would be unable to carry through the
part. She would open the door for him and as soon as
they were alone in the hall she would throw her arms
about his neck and kiss him, and how should he then
find words to tell her? His old love for her would
return to him; there would be further complications.
Perhaps he might write a letter to her, but he had only
to take up pen and paper to realise that this was impossible.
He could not express himself in writing; the
sentences that stared at him from the paper were cold
and stilted; they would wound her cruelly. He was
accustomed in times of perplexity to turn for advice to
Gerald. But this was hardly an occasion when that
was possible. Gerald was, after all, Muriel's brother.
There were limits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day brought Roland no nearer to a solution
of his immediate problem. Indeed he had not thought
of one till, on his way home, he boarded the wrong bus,
and on handing threepence and saying "Hammerton
Town Hall" was informed that the bus he was on
would take him only as far as Donnington before
turning off to Richmond. The word "Richmond"
gave him his idea. Richmond, that was it, of course
that was it! Why had he not thought of it before?
He would go round to Ralph at once and send him on an
embassy to April. So pleased was he with this inspiration
that he was actually shaking hands with Ralph
before he realised that the battle was not won yet, and
that he had before him a very awkward interview.</p>

<p>"Ralph," he said, "I want a word with you alone.
I don't want to be disturbed."</p>

<p>"Shall we go out for a walk then?"</p>

<p>"Right."</p>

<p>Ralph went into the hall, fidgeting his fingers in the
umbrella stand in search of his walking stick, did not
find it, and paused there indeterminate.</p>

<p>"Now, where did I put that stick?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't bother, please don't bother; we're only
going for a stroll."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, but if I don't find it now&mdash;let me see,
perhaps it's in the kitchen." And for the next three
minutes everyone seemed to be shouting all over the
house: "Mother, have you seen my walking stick?"
"Emma, have you seen Mr Ralph's walking stick?"
And by the time that the stick was eventually discovered,
in the cupboard in Ralph's bedroom, Roland's
patience and composure had been shattered.</p>

<p>"Such a fuss about a thing like that," he protested.</p>

<p>"All right, all right; I didn't keep you long. Now,
what's it all about?" And there was firmness in his
voice which caused Roland a twinge of uneasiness.
Ralph had developed since he had gone to Oxford.
He was no longer the humble servant of Roland's
caprice.</p>

<p>"It's not very easy," said Roland; "I want you to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
something for me. I'm going to ask you to do me a
great favour. It's about April."</p>

<p>"Why, of course," said Ralph, "I know what it is;
you're going to be married at once, and you want me to
be your best man&mdash;but I shall be delighted."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no, no," said Roland, "it's not that at all."</p>

<p>Ralph was surprised. "No?"</p>

<p>"No, it's&mdash;oh, well, look here. You know how
things are; there's been a sort of understanding between
us for a long time&mdash;three or four years&mdash;hasn't there?
Well, one alters; one doesn't feel at twenty-three as one
does when one's seventeen; we're altering all the time,
and perhaps I have altered quicker than most people.
I've been abroad a lot." He paused. "You understand,
don't you?" he asked.</p>

<p>Ralph nodded, understanding perfectly. Though
he did not quite see where he himself came in, he understood
that Roland was tired of April. But he was not
going to spare him. There should be no short-cuts, no
shorthand conversation. Roland would have to tell
him the whole story.</p>

<p>"Well?" he said.</p>

<p>Their eyes met, and for the first time in their relationship
Roland knew that he was in the weaker position
and that Ralph was determined to enjoy his triumph.</p>

<p>"All right," said Roland, "I'll go on, though you
know what I've got to tell you. I don't know whose
fault it is. I suppose it's mine really, but things have
happened this way. I'm not in love with April any more."</p>

<p>Again he paused and again Ralph repeated that one
word, "Well?"</p>

<p>"I don't love her any more, and I've fallen in love
with someone else and we want to get married."</p>

<p>"Who is it?"</p>

<p>"Muriel Marston."</p>

<p>"The sister of that fellow you play cricket with?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's it." He paused, hoping that now
Ralph would help him out, but Ralph gave him no
assistance, and Roland was forced to plunge again into
his confession. "Well, you see, April knows nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
about it. I've been a bit of a beast, I suppose. As far
as she is concerned the understanding still holds good.
She's still in love with me, at least she thinks she is.
It's&mdash;well, you see how it is."</p>

<p>"Yes, I quite see that. You've been playing that
old game of yours, of running two girls in two different
places, only this time it's gone less fortunately and you
find you've got to marry one of them, and April's the
one that's got to go?"</p>

<p>"If you put it that way&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, how else can I put it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, have it as you like."</p>

<p>"And what part exactly do you expect me to play
in this comedy?"</p>

<p>"I want you to break the news to April."</p>

<p>There was a long silence. They walked on, Ralph
gazing straight in front of him, and Roland glancing
sideways at him from time to time to see how the idea
had struck him. But he could learn nothing from
the set expression of his companion's face. It was his
turn now to employ an interrogatory "Well?" But
Ralph did not appear to have heard him. They walked
on in silence, till Roland felt some further explanation
was demanded of him.</p>

<p>"It's like this, you see&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Ralph cut him short. "I understand quite
well; you're afraid to tell her. You're ashamed of
yourself and you expect me to do your dirty work!"</p>

<p>"It's not that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, it is. I know you'll find excuses for yourself,
but that's what it amounts to. And I don't see
why I should do it."</p>

<p>"I am asking it of you as a favour."</p>

<p>"That's like you. Since you've met these new
friends of yours you've dropped your old friends one
by one. I've watched you, and now April, she's the
last to go. You haven't been to see me for three or
four months and now you've only come because you
want me to do something for you."</p>

<p>The justice of the remark made Roland wince. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
had seen hardly anything of Ralph during the last
three years.</p>

<p>"But, Ralph," he pleaded, "how can I go and tell
her myself?"</p>

<p>"If one's done a rotten thing one owns up to it. It's
the least one can do."</p>

<p>"But, it isn't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What isn't it? Not a rotten thing to make a girl
believe for four years that you're going to marry her
and then chuck her! If that isn't a rotten thing I
don't know what is!"</p>

<p>Roland was wise enough not to attempt to justify
himself. He would only enrage Ralph still further
and that was not his game.</p>

<p>"All right," he said. "Granted all that, granted
I've done a rotten thing, it's happened; it can't be
altered now; something's got to be done. Put yourself
in my place. What would you do if you were me?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't have got myself in such a place"; his
voice was stern and official and condemnatory. In
spite of the stress of the situation Roland was hard put
to it not to kick him for a prig.</p>

<p>"But I have, you see, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Even so," Ralph interrupted, "I can't see why you
shouldn't go and tell April yourself."</p>

<p>"Because April herself would rather be told by
anyone than me."</p>

<p>It was his last appeal and he saw that it had succeeded.
Ralph repeated the words over to himself.</p>

<p>"April would rather be told&mdash;&mdash;Oh, but rot! She'd
much rather have it out straight."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, she wouldn't; you don't know April as
well as I do. She hates scenes; she could discuss it
impersonally with you. With me&mdash;can't you see how
it would hurt her; she wouldn't know how to take it,
whether to plead, or just accept it&mdash;can't you see?"</p>

<p>He had won, and he knew it, through the appeal to
April's feelings. Ralph would do what he wanted,
because he would think that he was performing a
service for April.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>"I expect you're right," he said; "you know her
better than I do, but I'm doing it for her, not for you,
mind."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I understand."</p>

<p>"If it wasn't for her I wouldn't do it. A man should
do his own dirty work. And you know what I think
of it."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I know." He would make no defence.
Ralph might be allowed in payment the poor privilege
of revenge.</p>

<p>"And you'll tell me what she says?"</p>

<p>"You shall have a full account of the execution."</p>

<p>They walked a little farther in silence. They had
nothing more to say to each other, and at the corner of
a road they parted. It was finished.</p>

<p>Roland walked home, well satisfied at the successful
outcome of a delicate situation&mdash;the same Roland who
had congratulated himself five years earlier on the
diplomacy of the Brewster episode.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a></h3>

<p class="subtitle">THERE'S ROSEMARY ...</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Ralph</span> went round to see April on the next
morning, shortly after eleven o'clock. She had
just been out for a long walk by herself and, on
her return, had taken up a novel with which to while
away the two hours remaining to lunch-time. She had
left school eighteen months earlier, and time often hung
heavily on her. She did little things about the house:
she tidied her own room, mended her own clothes, did
some occasional cooking, but she had many hours of
idleness. She wished sometimes that she had trained
for some definite work. Women were no longer regarded
as household ornaments. Many careers were open to her.
But it had not seemed worth while during the last year
at school to specialise in any one subject. What was
the good of taking up a career that she would have to
abandon so soon? The first year in any profession was
uninteresting, and by the time she had reached a
position where she would be entrusted with responsibilities
her marriage day would be approaching. And
so, instead of looking for any settled work, she had
decided to stay at home and help her mother as much
as possible. It was lonely at times, especially when
Roland was away; she was, in consequence, much
given to daydreams. Her book, on this September
morning, had slipped on to her lap, and her thoughts had
refused to concentrate on the printed page, and fixed
themselves on the time when she and Roland would be
married. He had not been to see her at all the day
before. But the memory of his last kiss was very
actual to her. He had loved her then. She had had
her bad moments, when she had wondered whether,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
after all, he really cared for her, but she was reassured
by such a memory. And soon they would be married.
She would make him happy. She would be a good
wife.</p>

<p>A knock on the front door roused her from her reverie,
and, turning her head, she saw Ralph Richmond
standing in the doorway. She rose quickly, her hand
stretched out in friendly welcome.</p>

<p>"How nice of you to come, Ralph; you're quite a
stranger. Come and sit down." And as soon as he
was seated she began to talk with fresh enthusiasm
about their friends and acquaintances. "I saw Mrs
Evans yesterday and she told me that Edward had
failed again for his exam. She was awfully disappointed,
though she oughtn't really to have expected anything
else. Arthur's form master told him once that he
couldn't imagine any examination being invented
that Edward would be able to pass."</p>

<p>Ralph sat in silence, watching her, wondering what
expression those bright features would assume when
she had heard what he had to tell her. He dreaded
the moment, not for his sake, but for hers. He hardly
thought of himself. He loved her and he would have
to give her pain. In the end he stumbled awkwardly
across her conversation.</p>

<p>"April, I have got some bad news for you."</p>

<p>"Oh, Ralph, what is it? Nothing about your
people, is it?"</p>

<p>"No, it's nothing to do with me. It's about Roland."</p>

<p>Although she made no movement, and though the
expression of her face did not appear to alter, it seemed
to him that, at the mention of Roland's name, her
vitality was stilled suddenly.</p>

<p>"Yes?" she said, and waited for his reply.</p>

<p>"He's not hurt, or anything. You needn't be
frightened. But he wanted you to know that he has
become engaged to Muriel Marston."</p>

<p>She said nothing for a moment, then in a dazed voice:</p>

<p>"Oh, no, you must be mistaken, it can't be true, it
can't possibly!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>"But it is, April, really. I'm awfully sorry, but it is."</p>

<p>She rose from her chair, swayed, steadied herself with
her left hand, took a half pace to the window and stood
still.</p>

<p>"But what am I to do?" she said. She could not
bear to contemplate her life without Roland in it.
What would her life become? What else had it been,
indeed, for the last four years but Roland the whole
time? Whenever she had bought a new frock or a new
hat she had wondered how Roland would like her in it.
When she had heard an amusing story her first thought
had been, "Roland will be amused by that." When
she had opened the paper in the morning she had turned
always to the sports' page first. "Roland will be
reading these very words at this very moment."
Roland was the measure of her happiness. It was a
good day or a bad day in accordance with Roland's
humour. She would mark in the calendar the days in
red and green and yellow&mdash;yellow for the unhappy days,
when Roland had not seen her, or when he had been
unsympathetic; the green days were ordinary days,
when she had seen him, but had not been alone with
him; her red days were the happy days, when there had
been a letter from him in the morning, or when they had
been alone together and he had been nice and kissed
her and made love prettily to her. Her whole life was
Roland. Whenever she was depressed she would comfort
herself with the knowledge that, in a year or so she would
be married and with Roland for always. She could not
picture to herself what her life would become now
without him. She raised her hand to her head, in
dazed perplexity.</p>

<p>"What am I to do?" she repeated. "What am I to
do?" Then she pulled herself together. There were
several questions that she would wish to have answered.
She returned to her seat. "Now tell me, when did this
happen, Ralph?"</p>

<p>"He told me last night."</p>

<p>"I don't mean that; when did he propose to Miss
Marston?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>"During the week-end&mdash;on Saturday evening, I
think."</p>

<p>"Saturday evening!" she repeated it&mdash;"Saturday
evening!" Then he had been engaged to this other
girl on Monday night when he had kissed her. He had
loved her then, he had meant that kiss; she was certain
of it. And to April, as earlier to Mrs Whately, this
treachery seemed capable of explanation only by a
marriage for money. It was unworthy of Roland.
She could hardly imagine him doing it. But he might
be in debt. People did funny things when they were
in debt.</p>

<p>"Is she pretty, this Miss Marston?"</p>

<p>That was her next question, and Ralph replied that
he thought she was.</p>

<p>"But you've never seen her?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Roland told you she was pretty. Did he say
anything else about her?"</p>

<p>"No, hardly anything."</p>

<p>There was another pause. Then:</p>

<p>"I can't think," she said, "why he didn't come and
tell me this himself."</p>

<p>She said nothing more. Ralph saw no reason why
he should remain any longer. He rose awkwardly to
his feet. As he looked down at her, beaten and dejected,
his love for her flamed up in him fiercely, and,
with a sudden tenderness, he began to speak to her.</p>

<p>"April," he said, "it's been awful for me having to
tell you this. I've hated hurting you&mdash;really I have.
I know you don't care for me, but if you would look on
me as a friend, a real friend; if there's anything I can
do for you just now.... I can't explain myself, but if
you want anything I'll do it. You'll come to me, won't
you?"</p>

<p>She smiled at him, a tired, pathetic smile.</p>

<p>"All right, Ralph, I'll remember."</p>

<p>But the moment he had left the room all thought of
him passed from her, and she was confronted with the
grey, interminable prospect of a future without Roland.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
She could not believe that he was lost to her irretrievably.
He would return to her. He must love her
still. It was only two days since he had kissed her.
He was marrying this girl for her money; that was
why he had been ashamed to tell her of it himself. He
would not have been ashamed if he had really loved
this Muriel. Well, if it was money she would win him
back. She was not afraid of poverty if Roland was
with her; she would fight against it. She would earn
money in little ways; she would do without a servant.
His debts would be soon paid off. She would tell him
this and he would return to her.</p>

<p>That evening she walked towards the Town Hall at
the hour when he would be returning from the office.
She had often gone to meet him without her mother's
knowledge, and they had walked together down the
High Street in the winter darkness, his arm through
hers. Bus after bus came up, emptied, and he was
not there. She watched the people climbing down the
stairs. She had decided that as soon as she saw Roland
she would walk quietly down the street, as though she
had not come purposely to meet him. She would thus
take him off his guard. But, somehow, she missed the
bus that he was on; perhaps a passing van had obscured
her sight of it. And she did not realise that he was
there till she saw him suddenly on the other side of the
pavement. Their eyes met, Roland smiled, raised his
hat and seemed about to come across to her; then he
seemed to remember something, for he hurried quickly
on and was lost almost at once in the dense, black-coated
crowd of men returning from their office. The smile,
the raising of the hat, had been an involuntary action.
He had not remembered till he had taken that step
forward, that he had now no part in her life. He felt
she would not want to speak to him now. And this
action naturally confirmed April in her belief that
Roland was marrying Muriel for her money.</p>

<p>"It is me that he loves really," she told herself, and
she felt that if she were a clever woman she would be
able to win him back to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I am not a clever woman," she said. "I was
not made for intrigues and diplomacy." She remembered
how, four years earlier, she had learnt from a
similar experience that she was not destined for a life of
action. "All my life," she had told herself, "I shall
have to wait, and Romance may come to me, or it may
pass me by. But I shall be unable to go in search of it."
And it seemed to her that this fate had already been
accomplished. Roland still loved her; that she could
not doubt. But she had no means by which she might
recall him to her. "If I had," she said, "I should be
a different woman, and, as likely as not, he would not
love me."</p>

<p>On her return home she went straight upstairs to
her bedroom and, without waiting to take off her
hat, opened the little drawer in her desk in which
were stored the letters and the gifts that she had at
various times received from Roland. There was the
copper ring there that he had slipped on to her finger at
the party, the tawdry copper ring that she had kept so
bright; there was the score card of a cricket match,
the blue and yellow rosette he had worn at the school
sports when he had been a steward, a photograph of
him in Eton collars. She held them in her hand and
her first instinct was to throw them into the fireplace.
But she thought better of it. After all he loved her
still. Why should she not keep them? Instead, she
sat down in the chair and laid the little collection in
her lap and, opening the letters, she began to read
them through, one by one; by the time she had finished
the room had darkened. She would have to put on
another dress for the evening and do her hair. Already
she could hear her father's voice in the hall, but she felt
lazy, incapable of action; her hands dropped into her
lap, and her fingers closed round the letters and cards
and snapshots. Her thoughts travelled into the past
and were lost in vague, wistful recollection. Her
mother's voice sounding in the passage woke her from
a reverie. It was quite dark; she must light the gas,
and she would have to hurry with her dressing. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
getting late. She rose to her feet, walked over to the
bureau and put the letters back into the little drawer.
Her fingers remained on the handle after she had closed
it. And again she asked herself the question to which
she could find no answer: "What is going to happen
to me now?"</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a></h3>

<p class="subtitle">THE SHEDDING OF THE CHRYSALIS</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> official position of fiancé was a new and
fascinating experience, in the excitement of
which Roland speedily forgot the unpleasantness
that its announcement had caused in Hammerton.
It was really great fun. Important relatives were asked
to meet him, and he was introduced to them by Mr
Marston as "my future son-in-law." Muriel insisted
on taking him for walks through the village for the
pleasure of being able to say to her friends: "This is my
fiancé." And when he complained that he was being
treated like a prize dog, she asked him what else he
thought he was. Muriel had always been a delightful
companion and the engagement added to their relationship
a charming intimacy. It was jolly to sit with her
and hold her hand; and she was not exacting. She
did not expect him to be making love to her the whole
time. Indeed, he did not make love to her very often.
They kissed each other when they were alone, but then
kisses were part of the game that they were playing.
April had at first been too shy to pronounce the actual
word "kiss." She had evaded it, and later, when she
had come to use it, it had been for a long while accompanied
by a blush. There was no such reserve between
Muriel and Roland. Kisses were favours that she
would accord to him if he were good. "No," she
would say to him sometimes, "I don't think I'm going
to let you kiss me this afternoon. You haven't been
at all the faithful and dutiful lover. You didn't pay
me any attention at lunch; you were talking to father
about some silly cricket match and I had to ask you
twice to pass me the salt. I oughtn't to have to ask<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
you once. You ought to know what I want. No! I
shan't let you kiss me."</p>

<p>And then he would entreat her clemency: he would
hold her hand and kneel on the wet grass, an act of
devotion to which he would call her notice, and beseech
her to be generous, and after a while she would weaken
and say&mdash;yes, if he was very good he might be allowed
one kiss. No more! But when his arms were
round her he was not satisfied with one, he would take
two, three, four, and she would wriggle in his arms and
kick his shins and tell him that he had taken a mean
advantage of her; and when he had released her she
would vow that as a punishment she would not kiss him
again&mdash;no, never, not once again, and then would add:
"No, not for a whole week!" And he would catch
her again in his arms and say: "Make it a minute and
I'll agree," and with a laugh she had accepted his
amendment.</p>

<p>There were no solemn protestations, no passion, no
moments of languid tenderness. They were branches
in neighbouring boughs that played merrily in the
wind, caring more, perhaps, for the wind than for each
other.</p>

<p>They talked exhaustively of the future&mdash;of the house
they were going to build, the garden they would lay
out. "We'll have fowls," he said, "because you'll
look so pretty feeding them."</p>

<p>"And we'll have a lawn," she repeated, "because
you'll look so hot when you've finished mowing it."</p>

<p>They would discuss endlessly the problem of house
decoration. She was very anxious to have bright
designs, "with lots of red and blue in it." And he had
told her that she could do what she liked with the
drawing-room as long as she allowed him a free hand
with his own study.</p>

<p>"Which means that you'll have a nasty, plain brown
paper, and you'll cover it with ugly photographs of
cricket elevens, and it'll be full of horrid arm-chairs
and stale tobacco."</p>

<p>One day he took her up to Hammerton to see his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
parents and his friends. They intrigued her by the
difference from the type to which she was accustomed.</p>

<p>"It's awfully interesting," she said. "They are
so different from the sort of people that we see&mdash;all
jammed together in these funny little houses&mdash;all
furnished just the same."</p>

<p>"Yes, and all doing the same things," said Roland&mdash;"going
to the office at the same time, coming back at
the same time, and if it hadn't been for Gerald that
would have been my life. That's what I should have
been. I should have done exactly the same things
every day of my life except for one fortnight in the
year. And it would have been worse for me than for
most of them, because I've been at a decent school,
because I'd seen that life needn't be like that. These
people don't believe it can be different." He spoke
with a savage sincerity that surprised Muriel. She
had never known him so violent.</p>

<p>"Roland! Roland!" she expostulated. "I've
never heard you so fierce about anything before. Your
proposal to me was the tamest thing in the world
compared with that."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"I should hope so. I believe you hate Hammerton
more than you love me."</p>

<p>So the autumn passed, quickly and happily. And by
Christmas time they had begun to speak of an April
wedding. There was no reason for delay. Roland
was now making over seven hundred pounds a year,
and the Marstons were too certain of their son-in-law to
demand a long engagement. Yet it was on the very
evening when the date was fixed that Roland and
Muriel had their first brief quarrel. Roland had been
tired by the long discussion, and Muriel's keen vitality
had exasperated him. She was talking so eagerly of
her trousseau, her bridesmaids, the locality of her
honeymoon. She seemed to him to be sharing their
love, his and hers, with all those other people who had
no part in it. He was envious, feeling that their love
was no longer theirs. He was still angry when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
stood together on the landing to say good-night to each
other.</p>

<p>"I don't believe you care for me at all," he said,
"that you regard our marriage as anything more than
a pantomime, a glorified garden-party!"</p>

<p>A look of hurt amazement crossed her face.</p>

<p>"But, Roland!"</p>

<p>"Oh, you know what I mean, Muriel, you&mdash;well, all
these others!" He paused, unable to express himself,
then caught her quickly, roughly into his arms, and
kissed her hungrily. "I don't care," he said, "you'll
be mine soon, mine!"</p>

<p>She pushed away from him, her face flushed and
frightened.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't, Roland, don't!"</p>

<p>He was instantly apologetic.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Elfkin. I'm a beast. Forgive me, but
oh, Elfkin, you really are anxious about the marriage
for my sake?"</p>

<p>"Of course, silly!"</p>

<p>"I mean you're glad that we're going to be married
soon?"</p>

<p>She was surprised and at the same time amused by
the look of entreaty in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Don't look so tragic about it, of course I'm glad."</p>

<p>"But...." He got no further, for she had taken
his hands and was playing with them, slapping them
against his sides.</p>

<p>"Don't be such a silly, Roland, darling; you ought
to know how pleased I am. I'm looking forward to it
frightfully; and I know you'll be an awful dear to me."</p>

<p>She brought his hands together in one last triumphant
smack, and leaning forward imprinted a light kiss upon
his forehead. He tried to draw her again into his arms,
but she broke from him.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no, no," she said, and ran lightly up the
stairs. She turned at the corner of the landing to blow
a kiss to him. "Good-night, darling," and she was
gone.</p>

<p>It was not repeated. Doubt, remorse, hesitation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
were alike forgotten in the excitement of preparation.
He had arranged to take over the lease of a small house
on the edge of the Marston estate, and the furnishing of
it was a new and delightful game. The present tenants
did not relinquish possession till the end of February,
and during the intervening weeks Muriel and Roland
would prowl round the house like animals waiting for
their prey. They were finely contemptuous of the
existing arrangements. Fancy using that big room as
a drawing-room; it faced south-east, and though it would
be warm enough during the morning, it would be freezily
cold in the afternoon. Of course they would make that
the dining-room; it would be glorious for breakfast.
And that big room above it should be their bedroom;
they would wake with the sunlight streaming through
the window.</p>

<p>"You'll see the apple-tree while you brush your
hair," he told her. And they both agreed that they
would cut down the large walnut-tree in the garden.
It was pretty, but it shut out the view of Hogstead.
"It'll be much better to be able to look out from the
drawing-room window and see the funny old people
going up and down the village street." And Roland
reminded her how they had looked down on them that
day when they had leant against the gate: "Do you
remember?" And she had laughed and told him that
he was a stupid old sentimentalist, but she had kissed
him all the same. And then the great day had come
when the tenants began to move; they stood all the
afternoon watching the workmen stagger into the
garden, bowed with the weight of heavy furniture.</p>

<p>"I can't think how all that stuff ever got in there,"
Muriel said, and began to wonder whether they themselves
would ever have enough. "We've nothing like
as much as that."</p>

<p>And Roland had to assure her that they could always
buy more, and that anyway the house had been over-furnished.</p>

<p>"You couldn't move for chairs and chesterfields and
bureaux."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>It was two days before the last van rolled away and
Muriel and Roland were able to walk up the garden
path "into our own house." But it was a bitter
disappointment. The rooms looked mean and small
and shabby now that they were unfurnished. The
bare boards of the floors and staircases were dirty and
covered with the straw of packing cases, the plaster of
the wall showing white where the book-shelves had been
unfixed. And the paper that had been shielded by
pictures from the sunshine struck a vivid contrast to its
faded environment. Muriel was on the verge of tears.</p>

<p>"Oh, Roland, what's happened to our pretty
house?" she cried. And it took all his skill to persuade
her that rooms always did look small till they were
furnished, and that carpets and pictures covered many
things.</p>

<p>"But our pictures won't fit exactly in those places,"
Muriel wailed, "and all our small pictures will have
haloes."</p>

<p>"Then we'll get new papers," Roland said.</p>

<p>There were moments when it seemed that things
could not be possibly finished in time. On the last
week of March there was not a carpet on the floor, not
a curtain over a window, not a picture on the walls.</p>

<p>"I know what it'll be," said Muriel in despair, "we
shall have to go and leave it half-finished, and while
we're away mother'll arrange it according to her own
ideas, and her ideas are not mine. It'll take us all the
rest of our lives getting things out of the places where
she has put them. It's going to be awful, Roland, I
know it is. We oughtn't to have arranged our marriage
till we'd arranged our house."</p>

<p>Muriel was a little difficult during those days, but
Roland was very patient and very affectionate.</p>

<p>"You only wait," he said; "it looks pretty awful
now, but one good day's shopping'll make a jolly big
difference."</p>

<p>And it did. In one week they bought all the carpets,
the curtains, the chairs and tables, and Gerald was
dispatched with a list that Mrs Marston had drawn up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
of the uninteresting things&mdash;saucepans, frying-pans,
crockery&mdash;and with a blank cheque. "We can't be
bothered with those things," said Roland.</p>

<p>It was a hectic week. They had decided to spend
three hundred pounds on furnishing, and every evening,
for Roland was staying with the Marstons, the two of
them sat down to adjust their accounts, and to Muriel,
who had never experienced a moment's anxiety about
money, this checking of a balance-sheet was a delightful
game. It was such fun pretending to be poor, adding
up figures, comparing price-lists, as though each penny
mattered. She would sit, her pencil on her lips, her
account-book on one side, her price-list on the other,
and would look up at Roland with an imploring, helpless
glance, and: "Roland, dear, there's such a
beautiful wardrobe here; it's fifty pounds, but it'll
hold all my things; do you think we can afford it?"</p>

<p>And Roland would assume dire deliberation:
"Well," he would say, after an impressive pause, "I
think we can, only we'll have to be very careful over the
servant's bedroom if we get it." And Muriel would
throw her arms round his neck and assure him that he
was a darling, and turn again to the price-list.</p>

<p>And all the while the wedding presents were arriving
by every post. That, too, was great fun, or rather it
had been at the start.</p>

<p>The first parcels were opened with unbounded
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Oh, Roland, Mrs Boffin has sent us a silver inkstand;
isn't it sweet of her?"</p>

<p>"Muriel, come and look at these candlesticks; they
are beauties."</p>

<p>And letters of eager thanks were written. After a
week or so the game began to lose its fascination. The
gifts resembled each other; they began to forget who
had given what, and as they wrote the letters of
acknowledgment they would shout to each other in
despair:</p>

<p>"Oh, Roland, do tell me what Mr Fitzherbert sent
us!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can't remember. I'm trying to think who I've
got to thank for that butter-dish."</p>

<p>"The butter-dish!&mdash;that was Mr Robinson&mdash;but Mr
Fitzherbert?"</p>

<p>"But the butter-dish wasn't Mr Robinson; he was
the clock!"</p>

<p>"Then it was Mrs Evans; and, Roland, do, do think
what Mr Fitzherbert gave us."</p>

<p>And so it went on, till at last they began to show a
decided preference for cheques.</p>

<p>And there was the honeymoon: that had to be
arranged. Muriel would rather like to have gone
abroad.</p>

<p>"I've been only twice. We'll see all the foreigners,
and sit in cafés, and go to theatres and see if we can
understand them."</p>

<p>But Roland was not very anxious to go abroad.
He went there too often in the way of business.
He might meet people who at other times were
charming, but were not on a honeymoon the most
comfortable company. There would be the fatigue
of long journeys, and besides, he wanted Muriel to
himself.</p>

<p>"I don't want to go and see foreigners, I want to
see you."</p>

<p>"Well, you'll have seen a good deal of me before
you've finished."</p>

<p>"But, Muriel," and the firm note in his voice forced
her to capitulate.</p>

<p>"All right, all right, have it as you like."</p>

<p>And so, after much discussion, it was decided that
they should get a cyclist map of England, find a Sussex
village that was at least three miles from any railway
station, and then write to the postmaster and ask
whether anyone there would be ready to let them rooms
for a month.</p>

<p>"Three miles from anywhere! Heavens! but I
shall be bored; still it's as you wish. Go and get your
map, Gerald."</p>

<p>And with the map spread on the table they selected,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
after an hour's argument, to see if anything was doing
at Bamfield.</p>

<p>"It should be a good place," said Roland. "It's
just under the Downs."</p>

<p>In all this fret and fluster Mr Marston took the most
intense interest. It reminded him of his own marriage
and, finding his youth again in theirs, he spoke often of
his honeymoon.</p>

<p>"Do you remember, dear, when we went out for a
picnic in the woods and it came on to rain and we went
to that little cottage under the hill?" And again:
"Do you remember that view we got of the sea from the
top of Eversleigh?" Little incidents of his courtship
that he had forgotten a long time were recalled to him,
so that he came to feel a genuine tenderness for the wife
whom he had neglected for business, for cricket, and his
children; from a distance of thirty years the perfume
of those scented months had returned to him.</p>

<p>Gerald was alone unmoved. He was annoyed one
morning when he found the floor of the billiard-room
covered with packing cases, but he retained his hardly
won composure. He accepted the duties of best man
without enthusiasm. "At any rate it will soon be
over," he had said, and had proceeded to give Roland
two new white wood bats.</p>

<p>"They won't last long, but you can't help making
a few runs with them." And his friend was left to
draw from that present what inference he might think
fit.</p>

<p>They were hectic days, but at last everything was
finished. The house was papered and furnished, rooms
had been booked at Bamfield, and in the last week in
April Roland returned to Hammerton. He had had
scarcely a moment's rest during the last two months.
Life had moved at an incredible pace, and only with an
enormous struggle had he managed to keep pace with it.
He had had no time to think what he was doing. Each
morning had presented him with some fresh difficulty,
each night had left some piece of work unfinished. And,
now that it was over, he felt exhausted. The store of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
energy that had sustained his vitality at so high a
pressure was spent.</p>

<p>The sudden marriage was naturally a disappointment
to his parents. Their opinion had not been asked; the
arrangements had been made at Hogstead. Roland had
just told them that such and such a thing had been
decided, and they were hurt. They had known, of
course, all along that as soon as their son was married
they would lose him, but they had expected to retain
his confidence up till then; and, being sentimental,
they had often spoken together of the wife that he
would choose. They had looked forward to his days of
courtship, hoping to have a share in that fresh happiness.
But the pleasure had been given to others; they had
had no part in it.</p>

<p>In consequence Roland did not find them very
responsive. They listened attentively to all he told
them, but they asked no questions, and the conversation
was not made easy. Roland was piqued by their
behaviour; he had intended to arrange a picnic for
the three of them on the last day, but now decided that
he would not. After all, why should he: it would be
no pleasure for any of them, not if they were going to
sit glum and silent. Two days before his marriage he
went for a walk in the evening with his father, and as
Gerald would be coming on the next day to stay the
night with them this was the last walk they would have
together. But in nothing that they said to each other
was implied any appreciation of the fact. When Mr
Whately returned from the office he handed the evening
paper to his wife, commented on the political situation
in Russia and on the economical situation of France,
and was, on the whole, of the opinion that Spanish
cooking was superior to Italian, "Not quite so
much variety," he said, "but there's a flavour about
it that one gets nowhere else." He then proceeded
to remove his boots: "And what about a walk,
Roland?"</p>

<p>Ronald nodded, and Mr Whately went upstairs to
change his suit. They walked as usual down the High<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
Street, they turned up the corner of College Road, they
crossed by the Public Library into Green Crescent, and
completed their circuit by walking down into the High
Street through Woolston Avenue. They talked of
Fernhurst, of the coming cricket season, of the marriage
ceremony, of the arrangements that had been made for
meeting the guests at the church, of the train that
Roland and Muriel would catch afterwards. But there
passed between them not one sentence, question,
intonation of the voice that could be called intimate,
that could be said to express not remorse, but any
attitude at all towards the severing of a long relationship.
As they walked up the steps of 105 Hammerton
Villas they were discussing the effectiveness of the
new pull stroke that in face of prejudice so many great
batsmen were practising.</p>

<p>"I think I shall go down to the nets at the Oval
to-morrow, father, and see what I can make of it."</p>

<p>It was a bleak morning and the Oval presented a
dismal appearance; a few men were pottering about
with ladders and paint brushes; a cutting machine was
clanking on the grass; the long stone terraces were cold
and forbidding; the clock in the pavilion had stopped;
far over at the Vauxhall end a couple of bored professionals
were bowling to an enthusiastic amateur who
had no idea of the game, but demanded instruction
after every stroke. Roland stood behind the net and
watched for a while an exhibition of cross-bat play that
was calculated to make him for ever an advocate of the
left shoulder, the left elbow and the left foot. He had
a few minutes' chat with one of the groundsmen.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, it do look pretty dismal, but you wait.
April's a funny month; why, to-morrow we shall
probably have brilliant sunshine, and there'll be twenty
or thirty people down here, and when you go away
you'll be thinking about getting out that bat of yours
and putting a drop of oil on it." Roland expressed a
hope that this prophecy would prove correct.</p>

<p>April was a funny month: it was cold to-day, but
within a week the sun would be shining on green grass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
and new white flannels. Only another week! The
fixing of this date, however, reminded Roland that in a
week's time he would be in a small village under the
Downs, three miles from the nearest station, and this
reminder was somewhat of a shock to him. He would
miss the first four weeks of the season. By the time he
came back everyone else would have found their form;
it was rather a nuisance. Still, a honeymoon! Ah,
well, one could not have it both ways.</p>

<p>Gerald was not arriving till the afternoon, and the
morning passed slowly for Roland. He walked from
Kennington over Westminster Bridge and along the
Embankment to Charing Cross; he strolled down the
Strand, looking into the shop windows and wondering
whether he was hungry enough to have his lunch.
He decided he was not and continued his walk, but
boredom made him reconsider the decision, and he found
himself unable to pass a small Italian restaurant at the
beginning of Fleet Street; and as he had a long time,
with nothing to do in it, he ordered a heavy lunch.
When the waiter presented him with his bill he had
become fretfully irritable&mdash;the usual penalty of overeating.</p>

<p>What on earth should he do with himself for two
hours? How slowly the time was passing. It was impossible
to realise that in twenty-four hours' time he
would be standing beside Muriel before the altar, that
in two days' time they would be man and wife. What
would it be like? Pondering the question, he walked
along to Trafalgar Square, and still pondering it he
mounted a bus and travelled on it as far as a sevenpenny
ticket would take him. Then he got on to a bus that
was going in the opposite direction, and by the time he
was back again at Trafalgar Square, Gerald's train from
Hogstead was nearly due.</p>

<p>It was not a particularly exciting evening and the
atmosphere was distinctly edgy. Mr Whately was
bothered about his clothes, and whether he should wear
a white or a dark tie; and Mrs Whately was fussing
over little things. "Did old Mrs Whately know that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
she had to change at Waterloo? Had anyone written
to tell her? And who was going to meet her at the
other end?" It was a relief to Roland when they had
gone to bed and he and Gerald were left alone.</p>

<p>"It's a funny thing," Gerald said; "five years ago we
didn't know each other; you were nothing to me, nor I
to you, and then we meet in Brewster's study, and again
at the Oval and, before we know where we are you're a
junior partner in the business and engaged to my sister.
To think what a difference you've made to all of us!"</p>

<p>"And the funniest thing of all," said Roland, "is to
think that if I hadn't caught the three-thirty from
Waterloo instead of the four-eighteen, none of this
would have happened. I shouldn't have met that
blighter Howard, nor gone out with those girls; and,
even so, none of it would have happened if I had taken
my footer boots down to be mended, as I ought to have
done, on a Sunday afternoon instead of loafing in my
study. One can't tell what's going to be a blessing till
one's done with it. If I hadn't had that row I should
never have met you and I should never have met
Muriel." And he paused, wondering what would have
happened to him if he had caught the four-eighteen
and taken his boots down to be mended. He would
have stayed on another year at school; he would
have been captain of the house; he would have gone
up to the 'Varsity. He would have had a good time,
no doubt, but where would he be now? Probably an
assistant master at a second-rate public school, an ill-paid
post that had been given to him because he was
good at games. Probably also he would be engaged to
April, and he would be making desperate calculations
with account-books to discover whether it was possible
to marry on one hundred and fifty pounds a year.</p>

<p>"That now," he said, "was the luckiest thing for me
that ever happened."</p>

<p>And they sat for a while in silence pondering the
strange contradictions of life, pondering also the instability
of human schemes. One might plan out the
future, pigeon-hole it, have everything arranged as by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
a machine, and then what happened? Someone caught
a train at three-thirty instead of at four-eighteen, or
was too lazy to take his football boots down to be
mended on a wet afternoon, and the plans that had
been built up so elaborately through so many years
were capsized, and one had to begin again.</p>

<p>"And it's so funny," Roland said, "to think of the
fuss they made at Fernhurst about a thing like that&mdash;just
taking a girl out for a walk, and you'd think I'd
broken the whole ten commandments, and all the talk
about my corrupting the pure soul of Brewster."</p>

<p>Gerald broke into a great laugh.</p>

<p>"The pure soul of Brewster!" he said. "My lord!
if you'd known what he was like after he'd been
in the house a term. He'd have taken a blooming lot
of corrupting then. Gawd, but he was a lad!" And
Gerald supplied some intriguing anecdotes of Brewster's
early life. "He was a lad!" And Brewster's name
started a train of associations, and Roland asked Gerald
whether he had heard of Baker.</p>

<p>"Baker? Baker?" Gerald repeated. "No. I
can't say I ever remember hearing anything about
him. He must have been after my time."</p>

<p>Roland got up, walked across to his bureau, and
taking a bunch of keys from his hip pocket unlocked a
small top drawer. He took the drawer out and, bringing
it across, laid it on the table. It was full of photographs,
letters, ribbons, dance programmes, and he
began to fumble among them: "I think we shall find
something about Master Baker here," he said. "Ah,
yes, here we are!" And he handed across to Gerald a
large house photograph. "There he is, bottom row,
fourth from the right."</p>

<p>Gerald scrutinised the photograph, holding it to the
light.</p>

<p>"Lord, yes," he said, "that tells its own story;
what's happened to him now?"</p>

<p>"He was head of the house two years ago; he's gone
up to Selwyn. I believe he's going into the Church."</p>

<p>Gerald smiled. "When we all meet at an old boys'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
dinner in twenty years' time we shall get one or two
shocks. Think of Brewster bald, and Maconochie stout,
and Evans the father of a family!"</p>

<p>"My lord!"</p>

<p>And they began to rummage in the drawer, till the
table was littered with letters and photographs.</p>

<p>The photographs led them from one reminiscence to
another; and in that little series of isolated recollections
they lived again through all that had remained
vivid to them of their school-days.</p>

<p>"Heavens!" said Gerald, "who's that? You don't
mean to say that's Harrison! Why, I remember him
when he first came, a ridiculous kid; we used to call
him 'Little Belly.' About the first week he was there
he showed his gym. belt to someone and said: 'Isn't
it small? Haven't I a little belly?'"</p>

<p>"And here's Hardy," said Roland. "Do you remember
that innings of his in the final house match, and how we
lined up on each side of the pavilion and cheered him
when he came out?"</p>

<p>"And do you remember that try of his in the three
cock?&mdash;two men and the back to beat and only a couple
of yards to spare between them and the touch-line. I
don't know how he kept his foot inside."</p>

<p>And as the store of Fernhurst photographs became
exhausted they found among the notes and hotel bills
delightful memories of much that they had in common.</p>

<p>"The Café du Nord, Ghent! My son," said Gerald,
"do you remember that top-hole Burgundy? Yes,
here it is&mdash;two bottles of Volnay, fifty-three francs."</p>

<p>"Wasn't that the night when that ripping little
German girl smiled at us across the room?"</p>

<p>"And when I said that another bottle of Volnay was
better than any woman in the world."</p>

<p>A torn hotel bill at Cologne recalled a disappointing
evening in the company of two German girls whom
they had met at a dance and taken out to supper&mdash;an
evening that had ended, to the surprise of both of them,
in a platonic pressure of the hands.</p>

<p>"Do you remember how we stood under the cathedral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
and watched them pass out of sight behind the turning
of the Hohe Strasse, and then you turned to me and
said: 'There's no understanding women'?"</p>

<p>And then there was the evening when they had gone
to the opera in Bonn and had had supper afterwards
in a little restaurant, from the window of which they
could see the Rhine flowing beneath them in the moonlight,
and its beauty and the tender sentimental melodies
of Verdi had produced in both of them a mood of rare
appreciation; they had sat in silence and made no
attempt to express in talk the sense of wonderment.
Much was recalled to them by these pieces of crumpled
paper, and when Roland put away the drawer it seemed
to Gerald that he was locking away a whole period of
his life. And when they said good-night to each other
on the stairs Gerald could not help wondering whether,
in the evening that had just passed, their friendship
had not reached the limit of its tether. Roland was
beginning a new life in which he would have no part.
As he heard his friend's door shut behind him he could
not help feeling that never again would they reach that
same point of intimacy.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a></h3>

<p class="subtitle">AN END AND A BEGINNING</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">No</span> doubt the groundsman at the Oval rubbed his
hands together with satisfaction when he looked
out of his bedroom window on the following
morning. It was not particularly warm; indeed he
must have shivered as he stood with his shaving brush
in his hand, looking at the sky instead of at his
mirror. But the sky was blue and the sun was shining,
and he would, no doubt, be warm enough after he had
sent down a couple of overs at the nets. The thoughts
of Roland as he surveyed the bright spring morning
were not dissimilar. He saw in it a happy augury.
Summer was beginning.</p>

<p>They were a silent party at breakfast; each was
preoccupied with his own affairs. They had decided
to leave Charing Cross at twelve-thirty-five by a train
that reached Hogstead at half-past one; the service
was fixed for two o'clock. They would not need to leave
the house till a quarter to twelve. They had therefore
three hours to put in.</p>

<p>"Now, I suggest," said Gerald, "that you should
come down with me to the barber's and have a shave."</p>

<p>"But I've shaved already."</p>

<p>"I daresay you have, but on a day like this one can't
shave too often."</p>

<p>And Roland, in spite of his protests, was led down to
the shop. Once there, Gerald refused to be satisfied
with a mere shave.</p>

<p>"This is a big occasion," he said. And he insisted
that Roland should be shampooed, that he should
have his hair singed, that his face should be oiled and
massaged and his finger-nails polished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now you look something like a bridegroom." And
in defiance of Roland's blushes he explained to the girl
at the counter that his friend had intended to be married
unshaven.</p>

<p>"What would you think," he said, "if your fiancé
turned up at the altar with his hair unbrushed and chin
all over bristles?"</p>

<p>The girl was incapable of any repartee other than a
giggle and the suggestion that he should get along with
himself. Gerald then announced his intention of buying
a pair of gloves, and when he reached the shop he
pretended that he was the bridegroom and Roland the
best man. He took the shopmen into his confidence
and told them that the bride was very particular&mdash;"a
very finicking young person indeed"&mdash;and he must
have exactly the shade of yellow that would match her
orange blossom. He produced from his waistcoat pocket
a piece of flame-coloured silk. "It's got to go with
this," he said.</p>

<p>In the same manner he proceeded to acquire a
tie, a pair of spats, a silk handkerchief. As he told
his father afterwards, he did splendidly, and kept
Roland from worrying till it was time for them to
dress.</p>

<p>But the journey to the station was, even Gerald confessed,
pretty terrible. It was only five minutes' walk
and it had never occurred to them to hire a cab. They
wished they had, however, as they stepped down the
long white steps into the street that divided the even
from the odd numbered houses of Hammerton Villas.
Everyone they passed turned to stare at them. They
were so obviously a wedding party. "Which is it?"
they overheard a navvy ask his mate. "Should be the
one with the biggest flower in his button-hole."</p>

<p>"Garn, he's much too young!"</p>

<p>Roland hated it, and the half-hour in the train was
even worse. As soon as they reached Charing Cross
he made a dash for the platform, leaving Gerald to
collect the tickets. But his embarrassment was yet
to be made complete, for as he stood on the footboard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
of the carriage he heard a deep booming voice behind
him.</p>

<p>"Hullo, bridegroom!" And he turned to face the
bulky figure of a maiden aunt and the snigger of a
porter. He did not feel safe till he had heard the
scream of the driver's whistle, felt the carriage vibrate
beneath him and after two jolts pull slowly out of the
station.</p>

<p>He talked little on the journey, but sat in a corner
of the carriage watching through the window the
houses slip past him, till the train reached meadowland
and open country. He knew every acre of that
hour's journey. He had made it so often with such
eager haste. How much, he wondered, would not have
happened to him before the time came for him to make
it again? He tried to marshal the reflections that
should be appropriate to such an occasion, but he could
not. Life moved too fast for thought. A fierce rhythm
was completing its circle. He sat watching the landmarks
fall one by one behind him, appreciating confusedly
the nature of the experience to which he was
being hurried.</p>

<p>It was the same at the church. He did not feel in
the least nervous. He told a couple of good stories to
Gerald in the chancel; he settled the account with the
verger; he walked down the aisle and began to speak
to his friends as they took their places.</p>

<p>"So good of you to come; hope you had a pleasant
journey. See you afterwards."</p>

<p>Gerald was amazed: "You're wonderful! Why,
you're as calm as if you were at a tea-party!"</p>

<p>Roland smiled, but said nothing. He attributed no
credit to himself. How else should he behave? A
swiftly spinning top would, at a first glance, appear to
be poised unconsciously upon its point. It did not
begin to wobble till its pace was lost. And was not he
himself a swiftly spinning top.</p>

<p>He did not even feel nervous when a commotion in
the porch warned him of the arrival of his bride; he
stood firmly, did not fidget, fixed his eyes upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
door till he saw, framed there picture-wise, Muriel, in
white and orange, upon her father's arm. He then
turned and faced the altar. The organ boomed out its
heavy, ponderous notes, but he hardly heard them.
His ears were strained for the silken sound that drew
nearer to him every moment. He kept his eyes fixed
upon the altar, and it was the faint perfume of her hair
that told him first that she was beside him.</p>

<p>During the early part of the service he comported
himself with a mechanical efficiency. His performance
was dignified and correct. When he found a difficulty
in putting the ring on to her finger he did not become
flustered, but left her to put it on herself. The ceremony
had for him a certain emotional significance.
Once, as they stood close together, the back of his hand
brushed against hers and the cool contact of her fingers
reminded him of the serious oath that he was taking
and of how he was bringing to it a definite, if vaguely
formulated, ideal of tenderness and loyalty. He meant
to make of their marriage a reality other than the
miserable, dissatisfied compromise that, for the vast
majority of men and women, succeeded the first brief
enchantment. His lips framed no prayer; it had been
for a long while his belief that the moulding of a man's
fortunes lay within his own powers. But that desire
for happiness was none the less a prayer. It went as
quickly as it had come, and he was once again the lay
figure whose contortions all these good people had been
called together to observe. He remained a lay figure
during the rest of the afternoon.</p>

<p>He walked down the aisle proudly with Muriel on his
arm; in the carriage he took her hand in his, and when
they were out of sight of the church he lifted her veil
and imprinted a gentle kiss upon her cheek. He stood
beside her in the drawing-room and received each guest
with a swift, fluttering smile and a shake of the hand.
The majority of them he did not know, or had seen
only occasionally. They were the friends and relatives
of Muriel. There were only a few in whom Roland
was able to take any personal interest. Ralph was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
there, and April. He had not spoken to April since the
evening when he had kissed her, and he momentarily
lost his composure when he saw, over the shoulder of an
old lady whose hand he was politely shaking, the brown
hair and delicate features to which he had been unfaithful.
In what manner should he receive her?
But he need not have worried. She settled that for
him. She walked forward and took his hand in simple
comradeship and smiled at him. She looked very
pretty in a grey coat and skirt and wide-brimmed
claret-coloured hat. He recalled the day when she
had worn that hat for the first time and her anxiety
that she should be pretty with it. "You do like it,
don't you, darling?" But someone else was already
waiting with outstretched hand. "You looked so
sweet, Muriel, darling," an aged female was saying.
"Your husband's a lucky man!" And by the time
that was over, the cake was waiting to be cut and
champagne bottles had to be opened, and Roland was
passing from one group of persons to another, saying
the same things, making the same gestures: "Yes,
we're spending our honeymoon in England ... Bamfield,
a little village under the Downs ... Sussex's so
quiet ... such a mistake to try and do too much on
a honeymoon."</p>

<p>He had barely time to exchange a couple of remarks
with Beatrice. She came towards him, her hand
stretched out in simple comradeship.</p>

<p>"Good luck, Roland," she said. "You are going to
be awfully happy. I know you are."</p>

<p>"And when we come back you must come and see
us; won't you, Beatrice?"</p>

<p>"Of course I shall."</p>

<p>"Often," he urged.</p>

<p>"As often as you ask me."</p>

<p>Before he had time to reply an obscure relative had
begun to assure him of his wonderful fortune and of
his eternal felicity.</p>

<p>He caught glimpses of Muriel's white dress passing
through the ranks of admiration, and then he found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
himself being led by the arm to the table where the
champagne was being opened and a cricket friend of his,
a married man, was adjuring him to take as much as
possible. "You don't know what you're in for, old man."
And then Gerald was telling him that it was time he
went upstairs to change, that Muriel had gone already.</p>

<p>"You're really wonderful, old man," Gerald said,
when they were alone. "I can't think how you did it.
It's cured me of ever wanting to get married."</p>

<p>There were several telegrams lying on his dressing-table;
he opened them and tossed them half read upon
the floor. "Thank God I haven't got to answer those,"
he said. And while he changed into a grey tweed suit
Gerald continued to perform what he considered to
be the functions of a best man. He chattered about
the service, the champagne, the wedding-cake, the
behaviour of the guests. "And, I say, old son, who
was that mighty topping girl in grey, with the large
wine-coloured hat?"</p>

<p>"That? Oh, that was April&mdash;April Curtis."</p>

<p>"What! the girl that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's the one."</p>

<p>Gerald was momentarily overwhelmed. "Well, I
must say I'm surprised," he began. Then paused,
realising that as Roland had just married his sister it
was hardly possible for him to draw any comparison
between her and April. He contented himself with a
highly coloured compliment:</p>

<p>"A jolly pretty girl," he said, "and she'll be a
beautiful woman."</p>

<p>At that moment there was a tap at the door and Mrs
Marston's voice was heard inquiring whether Roland
had nearly finished.</p>

<p>"Hurry up, old man," said Gerald, "Muriel's ready."
And two minutes later he was running, with Muriel on
his arm, through a shower of rose leaves and confetti.
They both sank back into the cushions, panting,
laughing, exhausted. And as the gates of the drive
swung behind them they said, almost simultaneously:
"Thank heaven, that's over!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>But a moment later Muriel was qualifying her relief
with the assertion that it had been "great fun."</p>

<p>"All those serious-faced people came up and wished
me good luck. If I'd encouraged them they'd have
started taking me into corners and preaching sermons
at me."</p>

<p>But Roland did not find it easy to respond to her gaiety.
Now that it was all over he felt tired, physically
and emotionally. When they reached the station he
bought a large collection of papers and magazines, so
that their two hours' journey might be passed quietly.
But this was not at all in accordance with Muriel's ideas.</p>

<p>"Don't be so dull, Roland!" she complained. "I
want to be amused."</p>

<p>He did his best; they talked of all their guests and of
how each one of them had behaved.</p>

<p>"Wasn't old Miss Peter ridiculous, dressing up so
young?" said Muriel; and Roland asked whether she
didn't think that Guy Armstrong had been paying
rather marked attention to Miss Latimer.</p>

<p>"Why, he's been doing that for months," said
Muriel. "We've all been wondering when he's going to
propose. I don't mind betting that at this very moment
she's doing her best to make him. She's probably
suggested that he should take her home, and she's
insisted on going the longest way."</p>

<p>But Roland's conversational energy was soon exhausted,
and after a long and slightly embarrassed
silence Muriel tossed back her head impatiently and
picked up a magazine.</p>

<p>"You are not very interesting, are you?" she said.</p>

<p>Roland considered it wiser to make no response. He
settled himself back into his seat, rested his head against
his hand, and allowed his thoughts to travel back over
the incidents of the afternoon.</p>

<p>It had been a great success; there could be no doubt
of that. Everything had gone off splendidly. But he
was unaccountably oppressed by a vague sense of apprehension,
of impending trouble. He endeavoured to fix
his thoughts on reassuring subjects. He recalled his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
momentary talk with Beatrice, and remembered that
that afternoon he had addressed her for the first time
by her Christian name. She had shown no displeasure at
his use of it, and as she smiled at him he fancied he had
read in the soft wavering lustre of her eyes the promise
of a surer friendship, of deeper intimacy. He had seen
so little of her during the last few months. It would be
exciting to meet her on his return, at full liberty, on an
assured status, in his own house.</p>

<p>His reverie travelled thence to Gerald's easy good
humour, his unflagging energy, his bubbling commentary
on the idiosyncrasies of his father's friends, his
surprised admiration of April; and the thought of April
brought back in a sudden wave the former mood of
doubt and apprehension. How little, after all, he and
Muriel knew of one another; they were strangers
beneath the mask of their light-hearted friendship. He
looked at her out of the corner of his eye. Her magazine
had fallen forward on to her lap. Her eyes were fixed
dreamily on the opposite wall of the carriage. Her
thoughts were, no doubt, loitering pleasantly in a
coloured dream among the agreeable episodes of the
afternoon&mdash;her dress, her bridesmaids, her bouquets,
the nice things everyone had said to her. As he looked
at her, so calm, so self-possessed, Roland was momentarily
appalled by the difficulty of establishing on a new
basis their old relationship.</p>

<p>They had been comrades before they had been lovers.
In their courtship passion had been so occasional a
visitant.</p>

<p>They were both in a subdued state of mind when they
stepped up into the dogcart that had been sent to meet
them at the station.</p>

<p>"Tired, Elfkin?" he whispered.</p>

<p>"A little," she said.</p>

<p>The air was cold and she snuggled close to him for
warmth; he took her hand in his and held it, pressing
it tenderly.</p>

<p>They had a three-mile drive through the quiet
English countryside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>And it was quite dark when the dogcart eventually
drew up before a small cottage and a kindly, plump
woman came out to meet them.</p>

<p>"Ah, there you be!" she said. "I was just expecting
you. The supper's all laid out, and I've only
got to put the eggs on to boil, and there's some hot
water in the bedroom."</p>

<p>Roland thanked her, took down the two suitcases,
and followed her up the narrow creaking stairs.</p>

<p>"There," she said, opening a door. "There you
are. And if you want anything you ring that bell
on the table. I'll just run down and get on with the
supper."</p>

<p>Roland and Muriel were left alone in a small room,
the greater part of which was occupied by a large
double bed, over which had been hung, with a singular
lack of humour, a Scriptural admonition: "Love one
another." The ceiling was low, the window was overhung
with ivy. In midsummer it would be a stuffy
room. They looked at each other; they were alone
for the first time, and they did not know what to do.
There was an awkward silence.</p>

<p>"I suppose you'll want to tidy up," said Roland.</p>

<p>"Well, of course," she answered a little petulantly.</p>

<p>"All right, then; I'll go downstairs. Come and tell
me when you're ready."</p>

<p>She was standing between him and the door, and as
he passed her he made an ill-judged attempt to take her
in his arms. She was tired and she was dusty, and she
did not want to be kissed just then. She shook herself
away from him. And this mistake increased Roland's
despondency, accentuated his nervousness, his vague
distaste for this summoning of emotion to order, at a
fixed date and at a fixed hour.</p>

<p>Supper was not a cheerful meal; at first they attempted
to be jovial, but their enthusiasm was forced,
and long silences began to drift into their conversation.
They grew increasingly embarrassed and tried to prolong
the meal as long as possible. Muriel was not fond of
coffee and rarely took it, but when Roland asked her if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
she would like some she welcomed the suggestion: "Oh,
yes, do."</p>

<p>Mrs Humphries, however, had no coffee, but when she
read the disappointment of the young bride's face she
said she would see if she could not borrow some from
her neighbour. And while she ran over the village
street Muriel and Roland sat opposite each other in
silence; her hands were folded in her lap, and she stared
straight in front of her; he played with the spoon of
the salt cellar, making little pyramids of salt round
the edge.</p>

<p>At last the coffee arrived; its warmth momentarily
cheered them and they tried to talk, to make fun of
their friends, to scheme things for their future. But the
brooding sense of embarrassment returned. Roland, in
the intervals of occasional remarks, continued to erect
his pyramids of salt.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't, don't, don't," said Muriel impatiently;
"you get on my nerves with your fidgeting."</p>

<p>Roland apologised, dropped the spoon, and without
occupation for his hands felt more uncomfortable than
before. They continued a spasmodic conversation till
Mrs Humphries came in to tell them that she would be
going to bed directly.</p>

<p>"We get up early here," she said. And would they
please to remember to blow out the lamp and not to
turn down the wick, as her last lodger had done. She
wished them a good-night, and said she would bring
them a cup of tea when she called them in the morning.
They heard her bolt the front door and fasten the
shutter across the kitchen window, then tread heavily
up the creaking stairs. For a little while they listened
to her movements in the room. Then came the heavy
creak of a bedstead.</p>

<p>They were alone in the silent house.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose we must be going up," he said.</p>

<p>"I suppose so."</p>

<p>"Will you go up first and I'll come when you're
ready?"</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>He made no attempt to touch her as she passed him.
She paused in the doorway. A mocking smile, a last
desperate rally fluttered over her lips.</p>

<p>"Don't forget to turn the lamp out, Roland. My
last lodger...."</p>

<p>But she never completed the sentence; and their
eyes met in such a look as two shipwrecked mariners
must exchange when they realise that they can hold
out no longer, and that the next wave will dash their
numb fingers from the friendly spar.</p>
